One In This World

LRC by en_fly@msn.com

I've been searching for

A heart that needs a heart like mine

I've been reaching for

A hand that understands

I've been waiting for

Someone that I can love that loves me

Loves me for the one that I am

Someone to hold me when I'm lonely

Someone to keep the rain away

There's one in this world for everyone

One heart

One soul to walk besides you

One in this life to share your love

One touch

To touch the heart inside you

One to reach for each night

One to trust with your life

That's what I believe

You're the one

You're the one in this world for me

I've been praying that

Someone like you would rescue me

I've been hoping that

I'd find my way to you

I've been dreaming that

Somehow I'd finally find somebody

Somebody to make my dreams come ture

Somebody to hold me when i'm lonely

Someone to give my whole world to

There's one in this world for everyone

One heart

One soul to walk besides you

One in this life to share your love

One touch

To touch the heart inside you

One to reach for each night

One to trust with your life

That's what I believe

You're the one

You're the one in this world for me

Someone to hold me when I'm lonely

Someone to tell my secrets to

Someone who's living for me only

Someone to give my whole world to

They say

They say

They say

They say

There's one in this world for everyone

One heart

One soul to walk besides you

One in this life to share your love

One touch

To touch the heart inside you

One to reach for each night

One to trust with your life

That's what I believe

You're the one

You're the one in this world for me

You're the one

The one in this world for me

You're the one

You're the one
