Baby don't you worry

Baby don't be said

Cause I know You're feeling blue

And I wanna take it away

Baby I'll be here with you

To share your joys and woes

And each time You call

I'll be by your side I'll be holding you

So don't be afaid to reach for me

Let you heart and soul be free

And feel

NO matter what I'll stand by your side...

(So don't be afaid to reach for me)

Let the tears melt in my arms

And Konw

No matter what you do

And no matter how you hurt

I'll take your hands and alwaya be your friend

 ( MUSIC )

Baby don't you worry

Baby don't be said

Cause I know You're feeling blue

And I wanna take it away

Baby I'll be here with you

To share your joys and woes

And each time You call

I'll be by your side I'll be holding you

So don't be afaid to reach for me

Let you heart and soul be free

And feel

NO matter what I'll stand by your side...

(So don't be afaid to reach for me)

Let the tears melt in my arms

And Konw

No matter what you do

And no matter how you hurt

I'll take your hands and alwaya be your friend

Trust that you will see the light by

Holding on thruogh the darkest nights

So baby don't give up

You'll be there You'll be there

So don't be afaid to reach for me

Let you heart and soul be free

And feel

NO matter what I'll stand by your side...

(So don't be afaid to reach for me)

Let the tears melt in my arms

And Konw

No matter what you do

And no matter how you hurt

I'll take your hands and alwaya be your friend
