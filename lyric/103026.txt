Sleepless Nights

Norah Jones

Through these sleepless nights

I cry for you

And wonder who

Is kissing you

Oh these sleepless nights

Will break my heart in two

Somehow through the days

I don't give in

I hide my tears

That wait within

Oh but then through sleepless nights

I cry again

Why did you go

Why did you go

Don't you know

Don't you know

I need you

I keep hoping you'll come back to me

Oh let it be

Please let it be

Oh, my love, please end

These sleepless nights for me

Why did you go

Why did you go

Don't you know

Don't you know

I need you

I keep hoping you'll come back to me

Oh let it be

Please let it be

Oh, my love, please end

These sleepless nights for me

Oh, my love, please end

These sleepless nights for me

Oh, my love, please end

These sleepless nights for me
