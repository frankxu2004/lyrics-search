911

wa!!! 

guess who's back?!?! 

mommy! we're home!! 

say hello to my little friends 

dj muggs, soul assassins, cypress hill 

everybody! put your hands where my eyes can see!!! 

everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck 

fourty fifty samoans, they knowing when d-bo was 

50, tweezy, obie there won't be no hoe in us 

they pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does 

from new york down to texas, back up to los angeles 

we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust 

you may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us 

it's funny, i guess money does have its advantages 

and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched 

it's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much 

it's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch 

we just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it 

cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that 

you fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at 

that you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it 

no one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit 

and they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it 

the noise from be drowned out by the crowd 

and you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing 

till the club closes, and clears out 

and that's when they see you flatened 

nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping 

and you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping 

it ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off 

and it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off 

shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games 

we ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names 

shit just ain't the same, when the aks gettin sprayed cause 

hip-hop is in a state of 911 

it ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone 

it ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more 

it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor 

cause hip-hop is in a state of 911 

step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious 

all theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious 

thinking you coming with heat, yo son, i'm curious 

how long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us? 

some people can never fade us, that make us so furious 

mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious 

we living for real and others just making the stories up 

allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks 

if you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done 

when you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun 

got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none 

i'm like a rolling stone homie, i got you under my thumb 

silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches 

we cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches 

your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit 

dealing with the giant goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon 

about to change, cause we ain't playing no games 

we ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names 

shit just ain't the same, when the aks gettin sprayed cause 

hip-hop is in a state of 911 

it ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone 

it ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more 

it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor 

cause hip-hop is in a state of 911 

uh, gangsta ganxsta who come to pay you a visit 

on this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it 

when i - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded 

my appetite for destruction is blasted because i said it 

got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers 

but you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour 

when you - enter the business you thinking you running shit 

you witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit! 

we gangstas we blast first, ask questions later 

all these - imitators parading like they some playas 

trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater 

cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters 

get caught, i'm not telling, or more like killing not caring 

i'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying 

i'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed 

on an 8 mile mission with cypress and o.g.'s 

about to change, cause we ain't playing no games 

we ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names 

shit just ain't the same, when the aks gettin sprayed cause 

hip-hop is in a state of 911 

it ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone 

it ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more 

it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor 

cause hip-hop is in a state of 911
