[R&B] 

Yeah Yeah 

every body together 

just step by step 

just hand to hand 

over every ocean 

in every land 

Yo Yo 

without words 

we can understand 

Yeah 

burning,burning,burning 

let's burning love 

the Olympic torch 

Yo Yo 

step by step 

hand to hand 

over every ocean 

in every land 

without words 

we can understand 

over hill dale and river 

through city streets 

and countyside 

the sacred fire 

shines out everywhere 

the noble spirit 

runs far and wide 

burning burning burning 

the Olympic torch 

you and me 

burning burning burning 

the sacred fire 

drive the dark far away 

and river 

over hill dale 

through city streets 

and countyside 

the sacred fire 

shines out everywhere 

the noble spirit 

runs far and wide 

burning burning burning 

the Olympic torch 

you and me 

burning burning burning 

the sacred fire 

drive the dark far away 

burning burning burning 

the Olympic torch 

you and me 

burning burning burning 

the sacred fire 

drive the dark far away 

burning burning burning 

the Olympic torch 

you and me 

burning burning burning 

the sacred fire 

drive the dark far away 

burning burning burning 

the Olympic torch 

you and me 

burning··· ···
