Duran Duran - (Reach Up For The) Sunrise

Album: Astronaut

Now the time has come

The music's between us

Though the night seems young

Is at an end

Only change will bring

You out of the darkness

In this moment everything is born again

Reach up for the sunrise

Put your hands into the big sky

You can touch the sunrise

Feel the new day enter your life

Reach up for the sunrise

Put your hands into the big sky

You can touch the sunrise

Feel the new day enter your life

Now the fireball burns

We go round together

As the planet turns into the light

Something more than dreams to

Watch out for each other

Coz we know what it means to be alive

Reach up for the sunrise

Put your hands into the big sky

You can touch the sunrise

Feel the new day enter your life

Reach up for the sunrise

Put your hands into the big sky

You can touch the sunrise

Feel the new day enter your life

Feel the new day enter your life

Feel the new day

Reach up for the sunrise

Put your hands into the big sky

You can touch the sunrise

Feel the new day enter your life

Reach up for the sunrise

Put your hands into the big sky

You can touch the sunrise

Feel the new day enter your life

Reach up for the sunrise

Put your hands into the big sky

You can touch the sunrise

Feel the new day enter your life

<END>
