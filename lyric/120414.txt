Madonna - Isaac

影月孤风 上传

Staring up into the heavens

In this hell that binds your hands

Will you sacrifice your comfort?

Make your way in a foreign land?

Wrestle with your darkness

Angels call your name

Can you hear what they're saying?

Will you ever be the same?

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Remember remember and never forget

All of your life has all been a test

You will find the gate that's open

Even though your spirit's broken

Open up my heart

And close my lips to speak

In the heaven and the stars

Down to earth for me

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Wrestle with your darkness

Angels call your name

Can you hear what they are saying?

Will you ever be the same?

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo

Mmmmmm

Imininalo Imininalo
