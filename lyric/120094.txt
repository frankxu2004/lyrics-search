Now baby who's to blame

You keep my picture in a frame

Without room to move

Now show me the man

That could fit into your plan

Of a faultless love

Now we have to sail and we have to live

And we have to fail and we have to forgive

This is who I am

A part of me that you don't understand

And I love you still

I'm only riding through the hills

But it's a minor thing

You're still the one that makes me sing

Until the end of time

And you caught my love in a summer breeze

But sometimes there's a bird that I have to release

This is who I am

A part of me that you don't understand

And I love you still

I'm only riding through the hills

Can't you see you only want the best of me

Now you've got the ball don't you let it fall

This is who I am

A part of me that you don't understand

And I love you still

I'm only riding through the hills

This is how I feel

A little part of me that you don't understand

This is who I am

A little part of me that you don't understand

A little part of me that you don't understand

A little part of me that you don't understand

This is who I am

A little part of me that you don't understand

A little part of me that you don't understand

This is who I am

A little part of me that you don't understand

A little part of me that you don't understand
