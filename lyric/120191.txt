You Raise Me Up-Westlife

when I am down and oh my soul so weary

When troubles come and my heart burdened be

I am still and wait here in the silence

Until you come and sit awhile with me

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains

You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

I am strong when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up To more than I can be

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains

You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

I am strong when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up To more than I can be

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains

You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

I am strong when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up To more than I can be

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains

You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

I am strong when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up To more than I can be

You raise me up To more than I can be
