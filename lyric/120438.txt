I want to run

I want to hide

I want to tear down the walls

That hold me inside

I want to reach out

And touch the flame

Where the streets have no name

I want to feel, sunlight on my face

See that dust cloud disappear without a trace

I want to take shelter from the poison rain

Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name

We're still building

Then burning down love, burning down love

And when I go there

I go there with you...

It's all I can do

The cities a flood

And our love turns to rust

We're beaten and blown by the wind

Trampled into dust

I'll show you a place

High on the desert plain

High on the desert plain

Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name

We're still building

Then burning down love, burning down love

And when I go there

I go there with you...

It's all I can do

And our love turns to rust

We're beaten and blown by the wind
