C''mon c''mon

Yeah

Can you feel me?

(Baby can you feel me?)

I got something to say

Check it out

For all this time

I''ve been lovin'' you girl

Oh yes I have

And ever since the day

You left me here alone

I''ve been trying to find

Oh, the reason why

So if I did something wrong please tell me

I wanna understand

''Cos I don''t want this love to ever end

(And) I swear

If you come back in my life

I''ll be there ''til the end of time (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

(Oh yeah) And I swear

I''ll keep you right by my side

''Cos baby you''re the one I want (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

Oh yes you are (by my side)

I watched you go

Takin'' my heart with you

Oh yes you did

Every time I try to reach you on the phone

Baby you''re never there

Girl you''re never home

So if I did something wrong please tell me

I wanna understand

''Cos I don''t want this love to ever end

(And) I swear

If you come back in my life

I''ll be there ''til the end of time (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

(Oh yeah) And I swear

I''ll keep you right by my side

''Cos baby you''re the one I want (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

Oh yes you are (by my side)

Maybe I didn''t know how to show it

(How to show it)

Maybe I didn''t know what to say

(What to say)

This time I won''t disguise

Then we can build our lives

And we can be as one (be as one)

(And) I swear

If you come back in my life

I''ll be there ''til the end of time (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

(Oh yeah) And I swear

I''ll keep you right by my side

''Cos baby you''re the one I want (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

Oh yes you are (by my side)

(And) I swear

If you come back in my life

I''ll be there ''til the end of time (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

(Oh yeah) And I swear

I''ll keep you right by my side

''Cos baby you''re the one I want (Back to me, back to me, back into my life)

Oh yes you are (by my side)
