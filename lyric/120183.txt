Westlife - Change Your Mind

 ★ VAN制作

Hey, girl, it's all over town

So how come I'm the last to find out

That you're leaving, with some other guy

Help me understand why oh why

Tell, me, what he does for you

Is there something that I didn't do

All those late nights, I left you alone

I was working on our happy home

And then I come to find out

That you're about to walk out

Baby, why do you give me such a hard time

I know he said he loves you more than I

That's a lie

Let me change your mind

Oooh...

Baby, stop before you make a big mistake

Stop before you turn and walk away

Give me time

Let me change your mind

Oh...

I, know, if you ever leave

Baby someday, you'll look back and see

That it's right here, that you should've been

But you can run back to me

And don't make me look for someone new

When all I wanted is you

Baby, why do you give me such a hard time

I know he said he loves you more than I

That's a lie

Let me change your mind

Oooh...

Baby, stop before you make a big mistake

Stop before you turn and walk away

Give me time

Let me change your mind

Oh...

Don't make me look for someone new

When all I wanted is you

Baby, why do you give me such a hard time

I know he said he loves you more than I

That's a lie

Let me change your mind

Oooh...

Baby, stop before you make a big mistake

Stop before you turn and walk away

Give me time

Let me change your mind

Oh...Oh...Oh.....
