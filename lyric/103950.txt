I cannot take this anymore

Saying everything I've said before

All these words, they make no sense

I've found bliss in ignorance

Less I hear, the less you say

You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me

Take's me one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

I need a little room to pray

'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

I've found the answers aren't so clear

Wish I could find a way to disappear

All these thoughts. they make no sense

I've found bliss in ignorance

Nothing seems to go away

Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me

Take's me one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

I need a little room to pray

'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me

Take's me one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

I need a little room to pray

'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to

BREAK  (echo)

Shut up when I'm talking to you!

Shut up!

Shut up!

Shut up!

Shut up when I'm talking to you!

Shut up!

Shut up!

Shut up!

Shut ... UP!

I'm about to break

Everything you say to me

Takes me one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

I need a little room to pray

'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me

Takes me one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to break

I need a little room to pray

'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

And I'm about to

BREAK!

BREAK!
