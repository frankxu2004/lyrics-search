You can call me a sinner

But you can't call me a saint

Celebrate me for who I am

Dislike me for what I ain't

Put me up on a pedestal

Or drag me down in the dirt

Sticks and stones will break my bones

But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake

All of my fruit is yours to take

Better the devil that you know

Your love for me will grow

Because

This is who I am

You can like it or not

You can love me or leave me

Cause I'm never gonna stop, no no

Cleopatra had her way

Matahari too

Whether they were good or bad

Is strictly up to you

Life is a paradox

And it doesn't make much sense

Can it be filled without the router?

Please don't take offense

Don't let the fruit rot under the vine

Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine

Better the devil that you know

Your love for me will grow

Because

This is who I am

You can like it or not

You can love me or leave me

Cause I'm never gonna stop,

no no, you know

This is who I am

You can like it or not

You can love me or leave me

Cause I'm never gonna stop,

no no, you know

No no, you know

No no, you know

No no, you know

No no, you know

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake

All of my fruit is yours to take

Better the devil that you know

Your love for me will grow

Because

This is who I am

You can like it or not

You can love me or leave me

Cause I'm never gonna stop,

no no, you know

This is who I am

You can like it or not

You can love me or leave me

Cause I'm never gonna stop,

no no, you know

No no, you know

No no, you know

No no, you know

No no, you know

No no, you know
