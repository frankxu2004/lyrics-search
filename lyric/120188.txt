Westlife - That's Where You Find Love

 ★ VAN制作

In your eyes

I found the greatest prize

You and I could not be closer

And in your arms

Is everything I want

Now I know my search is over

And I don't know where you take me

But it's exactly where I wanna be

It's where the stars line up

It's where the oceans touch

It's in a place you've never been that feels like home

It's in the air right now

It's where you give your all

And give a little more

I've never been so sure

That's where you find love

People pass

And listen to us laugh

Wishing that they had the same thing

And our friends they ask

How we made it last

I just smile and say the same thing

I'm not sure how we got here

Baby I'm just glad that you got here

It's where the stars line up

It's where the oceans touch

It's in a place you've never been that feels like home

It's in the air right now

It's where you give your all

And give a little more

I've never been so sure

That's where you find love

That's where you find love

It's where the stars line up

It's where the oceans touch

It's in a place you've never been that feels like home

It's in the air right now

It's where you give your all

And give a little more

I've never been this sure

That's where you find love

Find love

That's where you find love
