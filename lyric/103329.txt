fading like a flower

Tell me why 

When I scream there's no reply 

When I reach out there's nothing to find 

When I sleep I break down and cry 

Cry, yeah 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 

But when we meet it seems I can't let go 

Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 

But when we meet it seems I can't let go

Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower

music...

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 

But when we meet it seems I can't let go 

Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
