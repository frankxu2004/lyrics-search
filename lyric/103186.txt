(Everything must change...)

Ends...

some people would rob their mother, for the ends

Rat snitch on one another, for the ends

Sometimes kids get murdered, for the ends

So before we go any further I want my ends.....

I knew this cat named Dell he didn't have a dollar

He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar

Had a PHD, an MBA, but now he's waiting tables, cause there's rent ta pay

Company's downsizing, Inflation's rising

Can't find a job, he's feeling kinda stressed

Doesn't even feel the effects when he says

Forgot to count how many times he been blessed

So he falls of track, starts smoking tha crack

And once it hits his brain, starts to chain react

Sells the shirt off his back, the shoes off his feet

He's loosin' all his teeth, now he's out in the street

And all of the sudden he's like Jesse James

Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains

But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool

So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool...

For the ends, some people would rob their mother, for the ends

Rat snitch on one another, for the ends

Sometimes kids get murdered, for the ends

So before we go any further I want my ends...

I knew this chick named Sally she had a nice strut

And everywere that I went she was up in the cut

Swingin' that butt, like place your add here

Only rock the benz, that rock the fly gear

Brand name wearing, champagne wavin'

Jewels around her neck, lay the style she craving

Aint no saving, she's doing all the spending

If you do the lending, she'll do the bending

Straight machine bending, it's money for tail

Shopping sprees get her on her knees

And if you hit her with the keys of your crib, your acting funny

Come home one day, find her counting out your money

From the Wetlands all the way to the Apollo

If you're broke she's spittin', and if you're rich she might swallow

For the ends, some people would rob their mother, for the ends

Rat snitch on one another, for the ends

Sometimes kids get murdered, for the ends

So before we go any further I want my ends...

I knew these two home boys, they made alot of noise

Making money on the block, kids was on their jock

They was tougher than leather, like Reverend Run

DMC, they was totin' guns

Holding weight, pulling down the state

Stacking mad chips, and pushing fat whips

Fly jewels and clothes, but got no job

And then one dissapeared, and one got robbed...

For the ends, some people would rob their mother, for the ends

Rat snitch on one another, for the ends

Sometimes kids get murdered, for the ends

So before we go any further I want my ends.....

Ends, some people would rob their mother, for the ends

Rat snitch on one another, for the ends

Sometimes kids get murdered, for the ends

Sometimes kids get murdered, for the ends
