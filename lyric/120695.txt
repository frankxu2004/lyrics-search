Two trailer park girls go round the outside;

round the outside, round the outside

*scratches*

Two trailer park girls go round the outside;

round the outside, round the outside

*scratches*

Guess who's back

Back again

Shady's back

Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back,

guess who's back, guess who's back

guess who's back, guess who's back,

guess who's back.. {*Eminem hums*}

I've created a monster,

cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more

They want Shady, I'm chopped liver (huh?)

Well if you want Shady,

this is what I'll give ya

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker

than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital

by the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rockin the table

while he's operatin (hey!!)

You waited this long, now stop debating

Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovu-lating

I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney

but your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be

or let me be me, so let me see

They try to shut me down on MTV

But it feels so empty, without me

So, come on and dip, rum on your lips

Fuck that, cum on your lips,

and some on your tits

And get ready,

cause this shit's about to get heavy

I just settled all my lawsuits,

FUCK YOU DEBBIE!

Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me

Cause we need a little, controversy

Cause it feels so empty, without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me

Cause we need a little, controversy

Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin rebellious

Embarrassed their parents

still listen to Elvis

They start feelin like prisoners helpless

'til someone comes along on a mission

and yells BITCH!!!

A visionary, vision of scary

Could start a revolution,

pollutin the airwaves

A rebel, so just let me revel and bask

in the fact that I got everyone

kissin my ass {*smak*}

And it's a disaster, such a castastrophe

for you to see so damn much of my ass;

you asked for me?

Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

{*bzzt*} Fix your damn antenna tune it in

and then I'm gonna

enter in, in the front of your skin

like a splinter

The center of attention, back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling

Investing in your kid's ears and nesting

{*bzzt*} Testing, attention please

Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me

Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus]

Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me

Cause we need a little, controversy

Cause it feels so empty, without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me

Cause we need a little, controversy

Cause it feels so empty, without me

A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with

anybody who's talkin this shit, that shit

Chris Kirkpatrick,

you can get your ass kicked

worse than them little Limp Bizket bastards

And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie

You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag,

blow me

You don't know me, you're too old, let go

It's over, nobody listen to techno

Now let's go, just gimme the signal

I'll be there

with a whole list full of new insults

I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil

ever since Prince turned himself

into a symbol {*knife slices*}

But sometimes the shit just seems

everybody only wants to discuss me

So this must mean I'm dis-gus-ting

But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No I'm not the first king of controversy

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley

to do black music so selfishly

and used it to get myself wealthy

(Hey!!) There's a concept that works

Twenty million other white rappers emerge

But no matter how many fish in the sea

It'll be so empty, without me

[Chorus]

Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me

Cause we need a little, controversy

Cause it feels so empty, without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me

Cause we need a little, controversy

Cause it feels so empty, without me

{*Eminem sings this twice:

"Chem-hie-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"*}

"Chem-hie-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"*}

[Eminem] Kids!
