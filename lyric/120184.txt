Westlife - Hit You With The Real Thing

It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up

I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate

I've almost got you there so let me take you all the way

a taste is stimulating keep you hot like

What (take it till you're high and low)

Like how (system overload)

Like who (sure you'r wanna rock the boat)

And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)

Like how (electro paradise)

Like who (if you wanna up your line)

And hit you with the real thing

Taste the infinity and mysteries surrounding you

Erotic stereo it's in the bass and trebble too

Come hold your hands above your head and let them

levitate

And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop

Like what (take it till you're high and low)

Like how (system overload)

Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)

And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)

Like how (electro paradise)

Like who (if you wanna up your line)

And hit you with the real thing

need you more than enough

ecstasy till your insane

find adrenaline rush

feel the power through your vains

and hit you with the real thing

(bring it till you're high and low)

(system overload)

I'm gonna show you how I'm rocking the boat

(rock you from the left to right)

(electro paradise)

I'm gonna hit you with the real thing

It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up

I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate

Come hold your hands above your head and let them

levitate

And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop

Like what (take it till you're high and low)

Like how (system overload)

Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)

And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)

Like how (electro paradise)

Like who (if you wanna up your line)

And hit you with the real thing

Like what (take it till you're high and low)

Like how (system overload)

Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)

And hit you with the real thing

What (rock you from the left to right)

Like how (electro paradise)

Like who (if you wanna up your line)

And hit you with the real thing
