IZZO / In The End - Linkin Park&Jay-Z

This is fun

Ladies and gentlemen,

put our hands together for the astonishing...

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world

The flow o\' the century...always timeless...HOV!(That\'s awesome)

Thank you for coming out tonight

You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you\'re here with us

We appreciate that

Uhh, H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Fo\' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA

Was herbin\' em in the home of the Terrapins

Got it dirt cheap for them

Plus if they was short wit\' cheese I would work wit\' them

Boy and we...got rid of that dirt for them

Wasn\'t born hustlers I was burpin\' em

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Fo\' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy

Can\'t leave rap alone the game needs me

Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain\'t easy

Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in

But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me

Therefore he doesn\'t exist

So poof...vamoose son of a bitch

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Fo\' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V.A.

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

That\'s the anthem get\'cha damn hands up

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Not guilty ya\'ll got-ta feel me

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A(check it out, yo)

(It starts with)

One thing, I don\'t know why

It doesn\'t even matter how hard you try

Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme

To explain in due time

(All I know)

Time is a valuable thing

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings

Watch it count down to the end of the day

The clock ticks life away

(It\'s so unreal)

Didn\'t look out below

Watched the time go right out the window

Tried to hold on, but didn\'t even know

I wasted it all just to

(Watch you go)

I kept everything inside

And, even though I tried, it all fell apart

What it meant to me will eventually be

A memory of a time when I tried so...

h-to-the-izz-O, v-to-the-izz-A, LP, jay-z, help me out

(aw, they having a good \'ol time out there)

it starts with... h-to-the-izz-O, v-to-the-izz-A, LP, jay-z, help me out

(aw, they having a good \'ol time out there)

it starts with... h-to-the-izz-O, v-to-the-izz-A, LP, jay-z, help me out
