Once I had a romance and I thought it would last forever

Love and dream was a true story and was more than ever

But, one day he said suddenly

that I don't love you any more

I never understand

Bang, bang..

He left through the door

Bang, bang..

He left me behind and closed the door

Now, here I am alone, and I don't want it to last forever

Love and dream of romance far away, it was more than ever

But, one day he left suddenly

said, I don't want you any more

How could I understand

One day, he said suddenly

that I don't love you any more

I never understand

Bang, bang..

He left through the door

Bang, bang

He left me behind the door

Bang, bang

He left through the door

Bang, bang

Now, I leave this romance and close the door

Once I had a romance and I thought it would last forever

Love and dream was a true story and was more than ever
