歌曲名称：One Summer Night

歌手： The Danleers

One summer night, we fell in love

one summer night, I held you tight

you and I, under the moon of love, moon of love

One summer night, I kissed your lips

one summer night, I held you close

you and I, under the moon of love

You kissed me oh, so tenderly

and I knew this was love

and I as held you, oh so close

I knew no one could ever take your place, ohhhh

One summer night, we fell in love

one summer night, I held you tight

you and I, under the moon of love, moon of love.

you and I, under the moon of love, moon of love.

You kissed me oh, so tenderly

and I knew this was love

and I as held you, oh so close

I knew no one could ever take your place, ohhhh

One summer night, we fell in love

one summer night, I held you tight

you and I, under the moon of love, moon of love.

you and I, under the moon of love, moon of love.
