Jesse McCartney - The Best Day Of My Life

LRC:Robin_SHI

I woke up 'round half-past ten

Can't believe I'm late again

Put down 'bout a quart of caffine

To start my pulse and then

I grapped my jeans off the floor

and I hit the door

Just the same old same

It goes to show

You never know

When everything's about to change

Just another day

Started out like any other

Just another girl

who took my breath away

Then she turned around

She took me down and

Just another day that I...

Had the best day of my life

Can't say exactly what it was

She's not the usual type

She wore a cowboy hat

With her red Pranda boots

And a Gwen Stefani smile

Then she pulled out a pen

and suprised me when

She wrote her number on my hand

Then she was gone

But from now on

I'm gonna be a different man

Just another day

started out like any other

Just another girl

who tooked my breath away

Then she turned around

She took me down

Just another day that I......

Had the best day of my life

I guess it goes to show

You never really know

When everything's 'bout to change

Just another day

Started out like any other

Just another girl

who tooked my breath away

Then she turned around

She took me down

Just another day that I......

Had the best day of my life

Just another day

Started out like any other

Just another girl

who tooked my breath away

Then she turned around

She took me down

Just another day that I......

Had the best day of my life

Had the best day of my life

Had the best day of my life

Had the best day of my life
