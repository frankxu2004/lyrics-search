歌名：Best Thing in My Life

词曲：Stanley Pong/ Ambrose

In times of loneliness

when I feel like giving

everything I own in my life

in exchange for a moment or two

just having you by my side

in times of desperation

when all could do is holding on

to what’s left of you

just thought of you

will always be true

you’re the best thing in my life

they say that love comes easy

as the love that goes

with the hours of the night

well you mornings were

always filled with

loving still in our eyes

you see I’m lost

I’m hopelessly

lost inside my mind all because of you

just the thought of you

will always be true

you’re the best thing in my life

and when the morning comes

andthe sun refuses to rise

and the night goes on

without a star in the sky

I’ll still be missing you

til the very day that I die

taking with me all the pain and mistery

forgotten sings and memories of you

if you could see me and hear the words

I wanted to say

with you I lived a lifetime

without you can’t face another day

if I could see you

if only I could tell you

just how much I really love you

just the thought of you

will always be true

you’re the best thing in my life

you’re the best thing

ever the very best in my life
