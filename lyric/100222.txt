Anything But Me

Nobody told me that being happy faces

just trying to erase the traces

What came before me

a girl that I used to see somewhere very deep

she′s falling asleep and I trying to wake her said her pray

Now is a never ending thing

One more minute turns into another

before I′ve had time to to run from all the other ones

and its so hard to live a dream

When the everything that they want you to be

is anything but me

So much confusion circling inside my head

What this one and that one said

Its all an illusion

Cuz I′m still the same person no matter how fast I run

I′m trying to hold on to where it is I come from

Now is a never ending thing

One more minute turns into another

before I′ve had time to to run from all the other ones

and its so hard to live a dream

When the everything that they want you to be

is anything but me

I′m trying to hold on to where it is I come from

I′m trying to hold on to where it is I come from

Now is a never ending thing

One more minute turns into another

before I′ve had time to to run from all the other ones

and its so hard to live a dream

When the everything that they want you to be

is anything but me
