Eternal Flame

Close your eyes,

give me your hand,

darling.

Do you feel my heart beating,

do you understand.

Do you feel the same,

am I only dreaming.

Is this burning an eternal flame.

I believe it's meant to be,

darling.

I watch you when you are sleeping ,

you belong to me.

Do you feel the same,

am I only dreaming.

Or is this burning an eternal flame.

Say my name,

sun shines through the rain.

A whole life so lonely,

and then you come and ease the pain.

I don't want to lose this feeling.

Say my name,

sun shines through the rain.

A whole life so lonely,

and then you come and ease the pain.

I don't want to lose this feeling.

Close your eyes,

give me your hand.

Do you feel my heart beating,

do you understand.

Do you feel the same,

am I only dreaming.

Is this burning an eternal flame.

Is this burning an eternal flame.

do you understand.

am I only dreaming.

Is this burning an eternal flame.

do you understand.

Do you feel the same,

am I only dreaming.

Is this burning an eternal flame.

Is this burning an eternal flame.
