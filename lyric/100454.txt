Yo, uh huh

Ooh, whoa whoa

Yo, uh huh

Yo

All dressed up you're

Good to go

Checkin' your style from

Head to toe (that's right)

Hooked up and natural

You're feelin' beautiful

Nine times out of ten

You know

Late night club like a video

With the

Hot stuff, top stuff, yo we

Got stuff (whoa whoa)

What a night (night)

So far (far)

Pullin' up curb side

In your car (your car)

What a sight (sight)

You are (are)

Think I know somewhere

We can park

After dark

System up with the top down

Got the city on lockdown

Drive by in the low ride

Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down

Got the city on lockdown

Drive by in the low ride

Hands high when we fly by

Girl it's time to let you know

I'm down if you wanna go

We can take it nice and slow

We got until tomorrow

UK style UK flow

We got you hot like (whoa)

With the hot stuff

Top stuff, we got stuff (oh)

What a night (night)

So far (far)

Pullin' up curb side

In your car (your car)

What a sight (sight)

You are (are)

Think I know somewhere

We can park

After dark

System up with the top down

Got the city on lockdown

Drive by in the low ride

(Low ride)

Hands high when we fly by

(Hands high)

System up with the top down

(Top down)

Got the city on lockdown

(Lockdown)

Drive by in the low ride

Hands high when we fly by

(Fly by, fly by, fly by)

Yo, yo, yo

Throw your hands in the sky

Wave 'em from side to side

Let me see you shake your body

All at the same time (uh uh)

Throw your hands in the sky

Wave 'em from side to side

Let me see you shake your body

All at the same time

What a night so far

Pullin' up curb side in your car

What a sight you are

Think I know somewhere

We can park after dark

System up with the top down

Got the city on lockdown

Drive by in the low ride

Hands high when we fly by

(Hands high)

System up with the top down

(Top down)

Got the city on lockdown

(Lockdown)

Drive by in the low ride

(Yeah)

Hands high when we fly by

(After dark)

System up with the top down

Got the city on lockdown

Drive by in the low ride

Hands high when we fly by

(We fly by)

System up with the top down

Got the city on lockdown

Drive by in the low ride

Hands high when we fly by

(Fly by, fly by, fly by)

(Fly by, fly by, fly by)
