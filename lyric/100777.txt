Sweetbox-More Than Love

(Music)

i know you dreams

i know you cries

each breath i memorized

and i would do anything to help you win your fight

but it's not enough to make you smile

it's never enough

woo more can i give

more than love

more than this

more than what's in these two hands

more than love

more than me

but i can't give more than i am

more than i am

i've seen the searching in your eyes

and i feel helpless by your side

so many spaces i can't fill

oh God knows how hard i tried

it saying no more, and i dying inside

you always be more

woo more can i give

more than love

more than this

more than what's in these two hands

more than love

more than me

but i can't give more than i am

no matter what i do it's never good enough for you

i'm trying to be everything that you need

and not every breathing

and you are still not happy

after all these have gone

oh i gonna be cold

it's never good enough for you

for what's fall in love

ah

more than love

(Music)

more than love

more than this

more than what's in these two hands

tell me what's more than love

tell me what’s more than this

well it's actually that i can never give

and what's more than love

that i can never give

(End)

(End)
