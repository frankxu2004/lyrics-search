Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

{music}

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

Once bitten and twice shy

I keep my distance

but still you catch my eye

Tell me baby

do you recognize me?

Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

(Merry christmas)

I wrapped it up and sent it

With a note said I love you I meant it

Now I know what a fool I've been

But if you kiss me now

I know you'll fool me again

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

{music}

Ooh-ooh-baby

Crowded room

friends with tired eyes

Hidding from you and your soul rivival

My god I thought you were someone to rely on

Me? I guess I was the shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with fire in his heart

A man undercover puts his heart in a part

Ah--ooh--now I found the real love

You never fool me again

You never fool me again

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

A face on a lover with fire in his heart

A man undercover puts his heart in a part

Ah--ooh--now I found the real love

You never fool me again

You never fool me again

{music}

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day

you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

I'll give it to some one special

Last X'mas

I gave you my heart

But the very next day
