陈秋霞 - I Will Follow Him

环球真经典系列之陈秋霞

Love him, I love him, I love him

And where he goes I'll follow,

------

I'll follow, I'll follow

I will follow him,

follow him wherever he may go

There isn't an ocean too deep

A mountain so high it can keep me away

I must follow him,

ever since he touched my hand I knew

That near him I always must be

And nothing can keep him from me

He is my destiny

I love him, I love him, I love him

And where he goes I'll follow,

I'll follow, I'll follow

He'll always be my true love,

my true love, my true love

From now until forever, forever, forever

--

I will follow him,

follow him wherever he may go

There isn't an ocean too deep

A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away

Away from my love

--

I love him, I love him, I love him

And where he goes I'll follow,

I'll follow, I'll follow

He'll always be my true love,

my true love, my true love

From now until forever, forever, forever

--

I will follow him,

follow him wherever he may go

There isn't an ocean too deep

A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away

Away from my love

I love him, I love him, I love him

And where he goes I'll follow,

I'll follow, I'll follow

He'll always be my true love,

I love him, I love him

And where he goes I'll follow,

I'll follow, I'll follow

I'll follow, I'll follow
