In your eyes you look so weary

Fighting light with dark and dreary

Even though you can’t hear me

I`ll still sing

You go to church and pray on Sunday

You think your sins are cleaned that away

Dont`t know forgiveness just begins with you

If you could read my mind

Just read my mind

Then you could see what`s behind my eyes

If you could read my mind

Get your hand suntied

Cause the battlefield is tired

Get a little bit stupid sometimes

Get a litlle bit jealous sometimes

Sometimes I’ll be unfair but that`s just me

I know that I`m not hiding

Now wont let your chains bind me

Because perfection is not the point of this

If you could read my mind

Just read my mind

Then you could see what`s behind my eyes

If you could read my mind

Get your hand suntied

Cause the battlefield is tired

If you could read my mind

Just read my mind

Then you could see what`s behind my eyes

If you could read my mind

Get your hand suntied

Cause the battlefield is tired

If love made sense

Then I think there would be a book

To tell us who is really right and wrong

But I don`t want something simple

I don`t want to sing a normal song

Woo......Yeah......

Close our eyes and let it be

Cause the battelefield is tired

If you could read my mind

Just read my mind

Then you could see what`s behind my eyes

If you could read my mind

Get your hand Suntied

Cause the battlefield is tired

Let`s just close our eyes and let it be

Cause the battelefield is tired
