I saw you walking

Down on melrose

You looked like an angel

Straight out of heaven, girl

I was blown away by

Your sexiness

All I have to do is catch up to you

Slow down I just wanna get to know you

But don't turn around

Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Now turn around

And bless me with your beauty, cutie

A butterfly tattoo

Right above your naval

Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl

Come take a walk with me

You'll be impressed by

The game that I kick to you

It's over and for reeaal

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready

To be watered by this conversation, you're ready

I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun

Let me be the one to enjoy you

Let's kick it girl

So Slow down I just wanna get to know you

But don't turn around

Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Now turn around

And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Slow down I just wanna get to know you (Know you baby)

But don't turn around

Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Now turn around

And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Oh baby you know by now that I want you bad

I'm floating on thin air I can't come down

Cupid hit me already damn

Now I can't leave till seven digits are in my hand, my hand

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready

To be watered by this conversation, you're ready

I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun

Let me be the one to enjoy you

Let's kick it girl

Slow down I just wanna get to know you

But don't turn around

Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Now turn around

And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Slow down I just wanna get to know you

But don't turn around

Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me (OHoo..)

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Now turn around

And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Cutie

Slow down I just wanna get to know you

But don't turn around

Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Now turn around

And bless me with your beauty, cutie

And bless me with your beauty, cutie
