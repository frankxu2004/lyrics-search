(Oh baby baby)

(Oh baby baby)

Oh baby baby

How was I supposed to know

That something was't right here

Oh baby baby

I shouldn't have let you go

And now you're out of sight,yeah

Show me how you want it to be

Tell me baby

'Cause I need to know now

Oh because

My loneliness is killing me

(And I) I must confess

I still believe (still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

Give me a sign

Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby baby

The reason I breath is you

Boy you got me blinded

Oh pretty baby

There's nothing that I wouldn't do

It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be

Tell me baby

'Cause I need to know now

Oh because

My loneliness is killing me

(And I) I must confess

I still believe (still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

Please give me a sign

Hit me baby one more time

(Oh baby baby,Ooh)

(Oh baby baby yay ,ayeah)

Oh baby baby

How was I supposed to know

Oh pretty baby

I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess

That my loneliness is killing me now

Don't you know I still believe

That you will be here

And give me a sign

Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me

(And I) I must confess

I still believe (still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

Give me a sign

Hit me baby one more time

I must confess that

My loneliness is killing me now

Don't you know

I still believe

That you will be here

And give me a sign

Hit me baby one more time

Hit me baby one more time
