歌名：Anywhere But Here

歌手：Hilary Duff

When I'm in a crowd

Or on an island by myself

Silent or too loud

Wishing I was somewhere else

And I can't believe

You hit me fast and hard

When you turn to me and say

Never change the way you are

Trying to catch your eye

Things will never look the same

Now I can't deny

You're the moth and I'm the flame

There I go again

I should walk before I run

How can I explain

I can't stop what you've begun

I'm falling through the door

Flying 'cross the floor

When you look at me suddenly it's clear

You're burning up my dreams

Crazy as it seems

I don't wanna be anywhere but here

Anywhere but here

What goes on inside

Is a mystery no doubt

A roller coaster ride

I may never work it out

Here's the brand new me

Skates around and floats on air

I'm a sight to see

Rainbow colors in my hair

You have set me free

The one who gets me there

I'm falling through the door

Flying 'cross the floor

When you look at me suddenly it's clear

You're burning up my dreams

Crazy as it seems

I don't wanna be anywhere but here

Anywhere but here

Here is the place where

My head is spinning

Time is beginning

To race away

You come to throw me

Knock me off my feet

You give me wings to fly

The world goes crashing by again

I'm falling through the door

Flying 'cross the floor

When you look at me suddenly it's clear

You're burning up my dreams

Crazy as it seems

I don't wanna be anywhere but here

Anywhere but here

I'm falling through the door

Flying 'cross the floor

When you look at me suddenly it's clear

You're burning up my dreams

Crazy as it seems

I don't wanna be anywhere but here

Anywhere but here

END
