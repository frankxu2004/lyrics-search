Sweetbox - After The Lights

Editor:星星兔(QQ:61919259)

Verse 1:

He met her backstage

She was supposed to be just another girl for the night

But there was something in her smile

That stopped his breath

She made everything make sense (oh...)

After the lights go down

And after the screams go dead

Her voice still echoes in his head

After the lights go down

And after the lust and fame

His heart still beats to the sound of her name

Sometimes he wakes up

Calling out for the one good thing he let go

In a lonely hotel room he tries to relive that night

And to see her smiling for him (oh...)

After the lights go down

And after the screams go dead

Her voice still echoes in his head

After the lights go down

And after the lust and fame

His heart still beats to the sound of her name

Oh...

The sound of her name...

Oooh maybe one day maybe one day oh...

Oh...the lights...go down...oh...

Years later he sees her

But when he sees her ring

His words escape

And he doesn't say he still tastes her kiss

And she's to scared to say

That her child's eyes are his (oh...)

After the lights go down

And after the screams go dead

Her voice still echoes in his head

After the lights go down

And after the lust and fame

His heart still beats to the sound of her name

His heart still beats to the sound of her name
