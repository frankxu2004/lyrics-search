Symptons Of You

There a good kind of pain

and insane kinda sane

when I'm around you 2x

There a chill in the heat

Feel the sky at my feet cuz I adore you

I cant ignore you

I'm not ill I don't need to

take a pill to fix what you do

Cure can come through

cuz baby all I do is suffer from

The symptoms of you

There is a left kinda right

There is a blind kinda sight

looking at you 2x

There is no light in the moon and its winter in June

When I'm without you 2x

I'm not ill I don't need to

take a pill to fix what you do

Cure can come through

cuz baby all I do is suffer from

The symptoms of you

And it trips me off my feet

I think I'm falling in too deep

Do you

feel it too

feel it too

I'm not ill I don't need to

take a pill to fix what you do

Cure can come through

cuz baby all I do is suffer from

I'm not ill I don't need to

take a pill to fix what you do

Cure can come through

cuz baby all I do is suffer from

The symptoms of you
