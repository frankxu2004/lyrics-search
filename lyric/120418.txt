I'm gonna tell you about love

Let's forget your life

Forget your problems

Administration, bills, and loads

Come with me

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the demonstration of this evidence

Some have call it religion

This is not a coincidence

Would you like to try?

Connect to the sky

Future lovers ride

there in mission style

Would you like to try?

Let me be your guide

Cut inside your pride

Future lovers hide

love inside their eyes

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

Love controlled by time

Future lovers shine for eternity

In a world that's free

Put away your past

Love will never last

If you're holding on to a dream that's gone

I'm gonna tell you about love

Would you like to try?

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

There's no love

like the future love

Come with me

Connect to the sky

Future lovers ride there in mission style

Would you like to try?

Connect to the sky

Future lovers ride there in mission style

Would you like to try?

(In the evidence of its brilliance) (repeat)

Connect to the sky

Future lovers ride there in mission style

Would you like to try?

Brilliance

Brilliance

Brilliance

Brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance
