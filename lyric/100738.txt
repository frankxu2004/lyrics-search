There For You - Flyleaf

QQ370678155

Sometimes I'm a selfish fake

You're always a true friend

I don't deserve you cause I'm not there for you

Please forgive me again

I want to be there for you

Someone you can come to

It runs deeper than my bones

I want to be there for you

Swirling shades of blue

slow dancing in your sky

The sun kisses the earth

and I hush my urge to cry

I want to be there for you

Someone you can come to

It runs deeper than my bones

I want to be there for you

Cause I hear the whispered words

in your masterpiece, beautiful

You speak the unspeakable through

I love you too

I want to be there for you

Someone you can come to

I want to be there for you

And be someone you can come to

The love runs deeper than my bones

And I want to be there for you

And I want to be there for you
