Sweetbox-Everytime

(Music)

Sometimes I question you and me

The reasons I'm here get hard to see

But when I feel your fingertips brush mine

I swear I see heaven for a moment in time

Been running and hiding

So scared of love

But everytime you look into my eyes

And everytime you kiss my lips good night

The honesty's too much

It's in the way we touch

It gets me everytime

Anytime you look at me that way

There's so much said when there's nothing to say

The sweetest thing I've heard

without a single word It gets me everytime

It gets me everytime

Sometimes I wake up next to you

And I wonder if you knew

That you would change my life with just one kiss

That you would be the one I'd fall in love with

I've been running and hiding

So scared of love

But everytime you look into my eyes

And everytime you kiss my lips good night

The honesty's too much

It's in the way we touch

It gets me everytime

Anytime you look at me that way

There's so much said when there's nothing to say

The sweetest thing I've heard

without a single word It gets me everytime

It gets me everytime

(Music)

But everytime you look into my eyes

And everytime you kiss my lips good night

The honesty's too much

It's in the way we touch

It gets me everytime

It gets me everytime

(End)

(End)
