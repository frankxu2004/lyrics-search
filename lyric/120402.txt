Nothing seems to be the way

That it used to

Everything seems shallow

God give me truth

In me

And tell me somebody's watching

Over me

And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday I will understand

In God's whole plan

And what He's done to me

Oh but maybe someday I will breathe

And I'll finally see

I'll see it all in my baby

Don't you run too fast my dear

Why don't you stop?

Just stop and listen to your tears

They're all you've got

It's in you

You see somebody's watching

Over you

And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday you will understand

In God's whole plan

And what He does to you

Oh but maybe someday you will breathe

And you'll finally see

You'll see it all in your baby

You'll see it all in your baby

No moment will be more true

Than the moment I look at you

It's in you

You see somebody's watching

Over you

And that is all i'm praying is that

Someday you will understand

In God's whole plan

And what He does to you

Oh but maybe someday you will breathe

And you'll finally see

You'll see it all in your baby

You'll see it all in your baby

You'll see it all in your baby

You'll see it all in your baby

You'll see it all in your baby
