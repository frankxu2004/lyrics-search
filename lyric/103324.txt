Aneka - Japanese Boy

He said that he loved me never would go

oh...... oh......

Now I find I'm sitting here on my own

oh...... oh......

Was it something I've said or done

That made him pack his bags up and run

Could it be another he's found

It's breaking up the happy home

Mister can you tell me where my love has gone

He's a Japanese boy

I woke up one morning and my love was gone

Oh my Japanese boy

ooh... I miss my Japanese boy

ah...........

People ask about him every day

oh...... oh......

Don't know what to tell them what can I say

Oh oh......

If only he would write me or call

A word of explanation that's all

It would stop me climbing the wall

It's breaking up the happy home

Mister can you tell me where my love has gone

He's a Japanese boy

I woke up one morning and my love was gone

Oh my Japanese boy

ooh... I miss my Japanese boy

Was it something I've said or done

That made him pack his bags up and run

Could it be another he's found

It's breaking up the happy home

Mister can you tell me where my love has gone

He's a Japanese boy

I woke up one morning and my love was gone

Oh my Japanese boy

ooh...........ah..............

Mister can you tell me where my love has gone

He's a Japanese boy

I woke up one morning and my love was gone

Oh my Japanese boy

ah...........
