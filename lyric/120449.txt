U2 - Miracle Drug

Album: How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb

I want to trip inside your head

Spend the day there...

To hear the things you haven't said

And see what you might see

I want to hear you when you call

Do you feel anything at all?

I want to see your thoughts take shape

And walk right out

Freedom has a scent

Like the top of a new born baby's head

The songs are in your eyes

I see them when you smile

I've had enough I'm not giving up

On a miracle drug

Of science and the human heart

There is no limit

There is no failure here sweetheart

Just when you quit...

I am you and you are mine

Love makes nonsense of space

And time...will disappear

Love and logic keep us clear

Reason is on our side, love...

The songs are in your eyes

I see them when you smile

I've had enough of romantic love

I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up

For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug

God I need your help tonight

Beneath the noise

Below the din

I hear a voice

It's whispering

In science and in medicine

"I was a stranger

You took me in"

The songs are in your eyes

I see them when you smile

I've had enough of romantic love

Yeah, I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up

For a miracle, miracle drug

Miracle, miracle drug

END

END
