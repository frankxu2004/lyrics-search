(Telephone Rings...........)

It's an illusion…

There's too much confusion...

It's an illusion…

There's too much confusion...

~~~~~~~~~~

Down, down, down in your heart

Find, find, find the secret

Turn, turn, turn your head around

Baby we can do it, we can do it all right

Do you believe in love at first sight?

It's an illusion, I don't care

Do you believe I can make you feel better?

Too much confusion, come on over here

(Chorus:)

Can we get together?

I really, I really want to be with you

Come on, check it out with me

I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

I search, I search, I search my whole life

To find, to find, to find the secret

And all I did was open my eyes

Baby we can do it, we can do it all right

Do you believe we can change the future?

Do you believe I can make you feel better?

(Chorus:)

Can we get together?

I really, I really want to be with you

Come on, check it out with me

I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

Can we get together?

I really, I really want to be with you

Come on, check it out with me

I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

It's all an illusion

There's too much confusion

I'll make you feel better

If it's bitter at the start, then it's sweeter in the end

Do you believe in love at first sight?

It's an illusion, I don't care

Do you believe I can make you feel better?

Too much confusion, come on over here

(Chorus:)

Can we get together?

I really, I really want to be with you

Come on, check it out with me

I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

Can we get together?

I really want to be with you

Come on, check it out with me

I hope you feel the same way too

It's all an illusion

There's too much confusion

I'll make you feel better

If it's bitter at the start, then it's sweeter in the end
