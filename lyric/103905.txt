Life Is Cool - Sweetbox

Life Is Cool

life is cool

life is

I never really try to be positive

I m too damm busy being negative

So focused on what I get

And never understand what it means to live

You know we all love to just complain

But maybe we should try to rearrange

There s always someone

Who s got it worse than you

life is

My life is so cool

My life is so cool

oh yeah

From a different point of view

life is

My life is so cool

My life is so cool

oh yeah

From a different point of view

We re all so busy tryin to get ahead

Got a pillow of fear when we go to bed

We re never satisfied

The grass is greener on the other side

So We get distracted by our jealousy

Forget it s in our hands to stop the agony

Will you ever be content

On your side of the fence

life is

My life is so cool

My life is so cool

oh yeah

From a different point of view

life is

My life is so cool

My life is so cool

oh yeah

From a different point of view

Maybe you re the guy who needs a second chance

Maybe you re the girl who s never asked to dance

Maybe you re lonely soul

A single mother sacred and all alone

Gotta remember we live what we choose

It s not what you say It s what you do

And the life you want

Is the life you have to make

life is

My life is so cool

My life is so cool

oh yeah

From a different point of view

life is

My life is so cool

My life is so cool

oh yeah

From a different point of view
