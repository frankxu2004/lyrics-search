Now You Know

Hilary Duff

by: Kong

In these eyes, Were the words more than

Anything that I've spoken

As the skies, Turn to grey my heart's

Just about to crack open

So the story goes

There's something you should know

Before I walk away and I blow the ending

I never want to be without you

Oh I go here you go now I know

What I feel about you

There's no runnin'

I must of been wrong about you

Oh no there I go no control

And I'm fallin' so now you know

Feel so light, Craving not searchin'

All this truth's left me empty

When you run, Can you handle it

'Cause I need you to tell me

Maybe this is bold

But I'm hoping you will stay for the happy ending

I never want to be without you

Oh I go here you go now I know

What I feel about you

There's no runnin'

I must of been wrong about you

Oh no there I go no control

And I'm fallin' so now you know

No I won't look back when I tell you what I think about you

No I won't look back when I tell you what I think about you

So the story goes, Yeah, you already know

So don't be a fool and go spoil the ending

I never want to be without you

Oh I go here you go now I know

What I feel about you

There's no runnin'

I must of been wrong about you

Oh no there I go no control

And I'm fallin' so now you know

I never want to be without you

Oh I go here you go now I know

What I feel about you

There's no runnin'

I must of been wrong about you

Oh no there I go no control

And I'm fallin' so now you know
