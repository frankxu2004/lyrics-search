Something I Never Had

Do you see me

do you feel me like I feel you

call your number

I can not get through

you don′t hear me and I dont understand

when I reach out I dont find your hand

Was it wasted words and did they mean a thing

and all our precious time but I still feel so in between

Some day I just keep pretending

that you′ll say dreaming of a diffrent ending

I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad

and I can′t keep something that I never had

I keep tell myself things can turn around with time

and if I wait it out you could always change your mind

like a fairy tale where it works out in the end

can I close my eyes have you lying here again

Then I come back down

They dont pay back and

then I realize its just what Its just what might have been.

Some day I just keep pretending

that you′ll say dreaming of a diffrent ending

I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad

and I can′t keep something that I never had

Am I a shadow on your wall

am I anything at all

anything to you

am I a sacrate that you came

do you dream me while your sleeping after all

Some day I just keep pretending

that you′ll say dreaming of a diffrent ending

I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad

and I can′t keep something that I never had

That I never had

I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad

and I can′t keep something that I never had

You dont see me

you dont feel me like I feel you

you dont feel me like I feel you
