Crash World

Hilary Duff

制作：vbagbk

Crash

That was you and me

Started out so endlessly

Shattered on the ground

I hear the sound

Crash

Ringing in my ears

I still feel the sting of my tears

Someone wake me

I can't seem to break free

Go on

Get out of my head

I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe

Am I alive or just dead

I've been somewhere in the dark

Living in a crash world

Hush

Don't say one more word

At this point the truth seems observed

Cut to the word

If gone forever

Crash

Underneath the fears

Everything's so twisted and weird

Someone save me

I can't seem to break free

Go on

Get out of my head

I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe

Am I alive or just dead

I've been somewhere in the dark

Living in a crash world

Crash world, yeah yeah

Slow motion

Devastation

Should've seen it

But I couldn't do nothing

emotion

Desperation

Someone save me

I can't seem to break free

universe universe parallel universe

Go on

Get out of my head

I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe

Am I alive or just dead

I've been somewhere in the dark

Living in a crash world

Go on

Get out of my head

I'm on the wrong side of a parallel universe

Am I alive or just dead

I've been somewhere in the dark

Living in a crash world

Crash world, yeah, yeah

Crash world
