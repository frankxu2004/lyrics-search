It's over and done

but the heartache lives on inside

And who's the one you're clinging to

instead of me tonight?

And where are you now, now that I need you?

Tears on my pillow wherever you go

I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean

You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart

It's just emotion that's taken me over

Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul

But if you don't come back

Come home to me, darling

Dont you know there's nobody left in this world

to hold me tight

Dont cha know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight

I'm there at your side,

I'm part of all the things you are

But you've got a part of someone else

You've got to find your shining star

And where are you now, now that I need you?

Tears on my pillow wherever you go

I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean

You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart

It's just emotion that's taken me over

Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul

But if you don't come back

Come home to me, darling

Dont you know there's nobody left in this world

to hold me tight

Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight

And where are you now, now that I need you?

Tears on my pillow wherever you go

I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean

You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart

It's just emotion that's taken me over

Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul

But if you don't come back

Come home to me, darling

Nobody left in this world

to hold me tight

Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight
