Sweetbox - On The Radio Lyrics

Album: Greatest Hits

Every year 525,600 minutes are gone

Did you hear me? 525,600 minutes are gone

Oh it’s just goodbye

Oh it’s just goodbye

Now I know that you’re paper not silk

But I shouldn’t cry for spilled milk

I know that the sun will still rise

‘Cause after all we just said goodbye and I’ll survive

Is there anyone on the radio?

Listen to my song and let it go (Mmmmm – radio – Mmmmm – radio)

Is there anyone on the radio?

Come along with me ‘cause I’m feeling low (Mmmmm – radio – Mmmmm – radio)

Oh is there anyone on the radio (So do you hear me?)

Come along with me ‘cause I’m feeling low

Ooh oh it’s just goodbye

I need to get back on my feet

‘Cause I took a real long hard fall

But I won’t cry for defeat

Yeah I’ll just smile because I loved at all

And I’ll stand tall

Is there anyone on the radio?

Listen to my song and let it go (Mmmmm – radio – Mmmmm – radio)

Is there anyone on the radio?

Come along with me ‘cause I’m feeling low (Mmmmm – radio – Mmmmm – radio)

Oh wasted 365 days on you

Oh wasted 365 days on you

Oh but I won’t regret a minute

Oh I won’t cry for lost time

Oh it’s just goodbye

I know that the sun will still rise

‘Cause after all we just said goodbye and I’ll survive

Is there anyone on the radio?

Listen to my song and let it go (Mmmmm – radio – Mmmmm – radio)

Is there anyone on the radio?

Come along with me ‘cause I’m feeling low (Mmmmm – radio – Mmmmm – radio)

Oh it's just goodbye

Every year 525,600 minutes are gone

Did you hear me?

Did you hear me?
