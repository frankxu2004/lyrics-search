Sarah McLachlan

Sunday is Gloomy

My hours are slumberless

Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless

Little white flowers will never awaken you

Not where the black coach of

Sorrow has taken you

Angels have no thought

Of ever returning you

Would they be angry if I thought of joining you

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Sunday is gloomy

with shadows I spend it all

My heart and I have decided to end it all

Soon there’ll be flowers and prayers

That are sad I know let them not weep

Let them know that I’m glad to go

Death is no dream

For in death I’m caressing you

With the last breath of my soul I’ll be blessing you

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Dreaming

I was only dreaming

I wake and I find you were

Sleeping in the deep of my heart

Dear

Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you

My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Uuu gloomy Sunday

Uuu gloomy Sunday
