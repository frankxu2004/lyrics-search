Christmas Song

演唱：杜德伟

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

Jack Frost nipping ar your nose

Yuletide carols being sung by a chair

And folks dressed up like Eskimas

Ev'rybody knows a turkey and same misletoe

help to make the season bright

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy

Too see if reindeer really knows to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

To Kids from one to ninety two

Although its been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

To Kids from one to ninety two

Although its been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas

Merry Christmas

Merry Christmas

to you
