Nobody Till You Lyrics 

Album : Speak 

Artist : Lindsay Lohan 

  

I never walked on water never saw

A reason to be going out that far

I never found a star that made a wish

But now the sky is listening to my hart

It can brake me, make me

If they want they can chase me

Love me, Hate me I dont care anymore

Chorus:

Till you, It was nothing but lonely nights

It was nothing but sad goodbye's

for me to fall through

Come true like change an awakening

somebody is making me

The only one in the room

But nobody can do, Nobody till you...

And the more you talk the less I fear

No matter what you say we are still in the same hemosphere

And its comforting just knowing that

Where ever I go a part of me is staying here with you

So take me shake me

if you want you can chase me

Love me for me and stay away from the door

Chorus:

Till you, It was nothing but lonely nights

It was nothing but sad goodbye's

for me to fall through

Come true like change an awakening

somebody is making me

The only one in the room

But nobody can do, Nobody till you...

Why can a world where if he

If you ever went away

Oh and I cant go back to where

i recon it will never be the same

Till you, It was nothing but lonely nights

It was nothing but sad goodbye's

for me to fall through

Come true like change an awakening

somebody is making me

The only one in the room

But nobody can do, Nobody till you...

Till you, It was nothing but lonely nights

It was nothing but sad goodbye's

for me to fall through

Come true like change an awakening

nobody know what to do

nobody till

nobody till you
