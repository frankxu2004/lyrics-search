The Calling - Wherever You Will Go

So lately, been wondering

Who will be there to take my place

When I'm gone you'll need love

To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all

Then between the sand and stone

Could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low

I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out

A way to make it back someday

To watch you, to guide you

Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all

Then I hope there's someone out there

Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low

I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart

You run away with my hope

You run away with my love

I know now, just quite how

My life and love might still go on

In your heart, in your mind

I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low

I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time

I'll go wherever you will go

If I could make you mine

I'll go wherever you will go

I'll go wherever you will go

END

END
