Sweetbox - Piano In The Dark

Daddy always said

These are the 88 keys to pain

And daddy always said

Rinse down the hurt before it stains

But daddy never said that after this not much remains

If only he told her to play her life instead of shame

When the lights go down

And the world@s asleep

She plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

She@s haunted by a whiskey melody

When she plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

No one understands

These are her 88 keys to pain (oooh...)

And no one ever sees her

Rinse down the hurt before it stains (mmm hmmm...)

But now she@s finally realized

Not much of her remains (oh oh oh oh)

If only she knew how to play her life like she plays her shame (oh...)

When the lights go down

And the world@s asleep

She plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

She@s haunted by a whiskey melody

When she plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

Daddy always said these are the 88 keys to pain...

Oooh...yes...

Oh huh...

88 (88 keys to pain)

88 (88 keys to shame)

88 (Oh...)

Oh...(that@s all she has)

When the lights go down

And the world@s asleep

She plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

She@s haunted by a whiskey melody

When she plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

When the lights go down

And the world@s asleep

She plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

She@s haunted by a whiskey melody

When she plays piano in the dark

Piano in the dark

She plays in the dark...
