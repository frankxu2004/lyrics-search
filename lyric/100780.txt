Buddy you are a boy make a big noise

Playin' in the street gonna be a big man someday

You got mud on yo'face

You big disgrace

Kickin' your can all over the place

Singin'

We will we will rock you

We will we will rock you

Buddy you are a young man hard man

Shoutin' in the street gonna take on the world someday

You got blood on yo'face

You big disgrace

Wavin' your banner all over the place

We will we will rock you

We will we will rock you

Buddy you are an old man poor man

Pleadin' with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day

You got mud on your face

You big digrace

Somebody gonna put you back in your place

We will we will rock you

We will we will rock you

We will we will rock you
