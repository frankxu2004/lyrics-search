lindsay lohan - very last moment in time

专辑：speak

very last moment in time

Time stops for no one,

It moves on unaware.

It's easy not to notice,

It's easy not to care.

Conversation circles,

There's money changing hands.

I've been standing in the middle,

I've been caught up in the spin.

But out of the confusion,

The static and the noise.

You got my attention,

And made me wanna

Live like it's the last moon rising.

Scream just like no one's there.

Lose all of my defenses,

Hold you, touch you, love you like,

It's the very last moment in time.

It seems like I woke up,

Beneath a different sky.

And I'm drunk on what I'm seeing,

Through these open eyes.

All the little ways you move me,

All the places you expose.

The illusion I held onto,

You've got me letting go.

I just wanna stay here,

Soaking up the rain.

Falling all around me.

Wash the world away.

Live like it's the last moon rising.

Scream just like no one's there.

Lose all of my defenses,

Hold you, touch you, love you like,

It's the very last moment in time.

Let me feel you next to me.

Let me taste the breath you breathe.

Open up the space,

Between us.

Between us.

Live like it's the last moon rising.

Scream just like no one's there.

Lose all of my defenses,

Hold you, touch you, love you like,

It's the very last moment in time.

Live like it's the last moon rising.

Scream just like no one's there.

Lose all of my defenses,

Hold you, touch you, love you like,

It's the very last moment in time.
