All the things she said

t.A.T.u

灼目 制作

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (3x)

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (2x)

All the things she said

All the things she said

This is not enough,

enough (Echo 3x)

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost

If I'm asking for help it's only because

Being with you has opened my eyes

Could I eva believe such a perfect surprise?

I keep asking myself, wondering how

I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out

Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me

Nobody else so we can be free (Echo 1x)

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (3x)

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (2x)

All the things she said

This is not enough [wa wa] (2x)

All the things she said（汗~一直在重复）

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed

They say it's my fault but I want her so much

Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain

Come in over my face, wash away all the shame

When they stop and stare - don't worry me

Cause I'm feelin' for her what she's feeling for me

I can try to pretend, I can try to forget

But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (3x)

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (2x)

All the things she said

This is not enough (2x)

All the things she said （重复重复重复~）

Mother looking at me

Tell me what do you see?

Yes, I've lost my mind

Daddy lookin' at me

Will I eva be free?

Have I crossed the line?

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (3x)

All the things she said

All the things she said

Runnin' through my head (2x)

All the things she said

This is not enough (2x)

All the things she said (Echo 3x)
