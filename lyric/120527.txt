So tight, so fly

You got me lifted, you got me lifted

[Frankie J.]

You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling

And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling

You got me lifted feeling so gifted

Suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

[Baby Bash]

You know its leather when we ride

Wood grain and raw hide

Doing what we do, watching screens getting high

Girl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns

You was there when the money was gone

You'll be there when the money comes

Off top I cain't lie I love to get blowed

You my lil'sugar, I'm yo little chulo

And every time we kick it it's off to the groovy

Treat you like my sticky ickey or my sweet oowy goowy (fa real though)

[Frankie J.]

You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling

And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling

You got me lifted feeling so gifted

Suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

[Baby Bash]

Now I ain't worried about a thang cause I just hit me a lick

I got a fat sack and a superfly chick

That ain't nothing you can say to a playa

Cause doowop, she fly like the planes in the air

That's right she's full grown settin' the wrong tone

Im diggin' the energy and im lovin the o-zone

So fly like a dove so fly like a raven

Quick to politic with some fly conversation

In a natural mood then im a natural dude

And we some natural fools blowin out by the pool

She like my sexy-cool mama with blades on her berata

Rockin Dolce' Gubbana with high-drows and a igwana

[Frankie J.]

You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling

And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling

You got me lifted feeling so gifted

Suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

[BRIGE]

You know its leather when we ride

Wood grain and raw hide

Doing what we do, watching screens getting high

Girl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns

You was there when the money was gone

You'll be there when the money comes

You know its leather when we ride

Wood grain and raw hide

Doing what we do, watching screens getting high

Girl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns

You was there when the money was gone

You'll be there when the money comes (fa real though)

[Frankie J.]

You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling

And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling

You got me lifted feeling so gifted

Suga how you get so fly?

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

So high like I'm a star

Feelin so high like I'm a star

Feelin so high like I'm a star

Feelin so high like I'm a star

Feelin so high like I'm a star
