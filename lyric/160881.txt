Lyrics:Paul Simon Music:Paul Simon　Arranger:George Leong

When you're weary,feeling small

When tears are in your eyes

I will dry them all

I'm on your side.When times get rough

And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down.

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down.

When you are down and out when you're on the street

When evening falls so hard

I will comfort you.

I take your part when the darkness comes

And pain is all around.

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down.

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down.

Sail on silver girl,Sail on by

Your time has come to shine.

All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine.If you need a friend.

I'm sailing right behind.

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down.

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down.

Yes I’ll,yes I’ll Lay me down

Yes I’ll,yes I’ll Lay me down
