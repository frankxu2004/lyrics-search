歌名：Heaven Knows

演唱：李吉汉

专辑：李吉汉 首张同名专辑

She's always on my mind

From the time I wake up,

Till I close my eyes

She's everywhere I go

She's all I know

And though she's so far away,

It just keeps getting stronger everyday

And even now she's gone

I'm still holding on

So tell me, where do I start

'Coz it's breakin' my heart

Don't wanna let her go

Maybe my love will come back someday

Only heaven knows

And maybe our hearts will find a way

But only heaven knows

And all I can do is hope & pray

'Coz heaven knows.

My friends keep telling me

That if you really love her,

You've gotta set her free

And if she returns in time

I'll know she's mine

But tell me, where do I start

'Coz it's breakin' my heart

Don't wanna let her go

Maybe my love will come back someday

Only heaven knows

And maybe our hearts will find a way

But only heaven knows

And all I can do is hope & pray

'Coz heaven knows.

Why I live in despair

'Coz wide awake or dreamin',

I know she's never there

And all the time I act so brave,

I'm shakin' inside

Why does it hurt me so?

Maybe my love will come back someday

Only heaven knows

And maybe our hearts will find a way

But only heaven knows

And all I can do is hope & pray

'Coz heaven knows.

Heaven knows... heaven knows
