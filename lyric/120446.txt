U2 - Vertigo

By Stoneage

Unos, dos, tres, catorce

Turn it up loud, captain!

Lights go down

It's dark

The jungle is your head

Can't rule your heart

I'm feeling so much stronger

Than I thought

Your eyes are wide

And though your soul

it can't be bought

your mind can wander

Hello, Hello

Hola!

I'm at a place called vertigo

It's everything I wish I didn't know

Except you give me something I can feel

Feel

The night is full of holes

Those bullets rip the sky

Of ink with gold

They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll

They know that they can't dance

At least they know

I can't stand the beat

I'm askin' for the cheque

Girl with crimson nails

Has Jesus 'round the neck

Swinging to the music

Swinging to the music

Woooao

Hello, Hello

Hola!

I'm at a place called Vertigo

It's everything I wish I didn't know

But you give me something I can feel

Feel

All this, all this can be yours

All of this, all of this can be yours

All this, all of this can be yours

Just give me what I want

And no one gets hurt

Hello, Hello

Hola!

I'm at a place called Vertigo

Lights go down and all I know

Is that you give me something

I can feel you're teaching me ...aaahhh

Your love is teaching me ...aaaah

How to kneel

Kneel

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
