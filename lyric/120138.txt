Every time, the rain comes down

Close my eyes and listen

I can hear the lonesome sound

All the sky, as it cries

Listen to the rain!

Here it comes again!

Hear it in the rain!

Feel the touch of tears that fall

They won't fall forever

In the way, the day will flow

All things come, all things gone

Listen to the rain!

Here it comes again!

Hear it in the rain!

Late at night, I drift away

I can hear you calling

And my name is in the rain

Leaves on trees, whispering

Deep blue seas, mystery

Even when this moment ends

Can't let go this feeling

Every day will come again in the sound falling down

Off the sky, as it cries

Hear my name in the rain

Hear my name in the rain
