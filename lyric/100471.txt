Like a Fool I went and stayed too long

Now I'm wondering if your loves still strong

Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

In that time I went and said goodbye

Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry

Ooh baby, here I am signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed yeah)

I've done a lot of foolish things

That I really didn't mean (wrap me up)

Hey, hey yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby (c'mon)

Seen a lot of things in this old world

When I touched them they did nothing, girl

Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered,

I'm yours, oh I'm yours

Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire

That's why I know you are my heart's only desire

Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby (unwrap me baby)

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours(got the future in your hand)

Here I am baby (unwrap me baby)

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours(got the future in your hand)

Hold my hand, let me know you can

Hold my hand, let me know you can

Tell me what you want me to do

Hold my hand let me know you can

Here I am baby, baby (That's right)

Hold my hand let me know you can

Here I am baby, baby

Here I am baby

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am pretty baby

Here I am baby (unwrap me baby)

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed, delivered)

Here I am pretty baby (Where you at)

Here I am baby

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am pretty baby (sing to me now)

Here I am baby

Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed, delivered)

Sing a little more

Baby, baby, baby

Here I am pretty baby

Angie Stone, Stevie

That'll work

That'll work
