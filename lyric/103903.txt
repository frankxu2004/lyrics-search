Waterfalls

Sweetbox

        by rummyjulia

        to my pretty boy~_*

I'm your very own Mary Magdalene

And your cross is the one I'll be carrying

Watching over you

I'm always watching you

I know you think that my head's a bit unbalanced, right?

But you don't see I'm just rising to the challenge

Cause you don't understand

After all you're just a man

Hit ya like a waterfall

Waterfalls

Waterfalls

You belong to me

You will belong to me

Waterfalls

Waterfalls

You belong to me

You will belong to me

Sitting in my car watching you through window panes

They say it's sick

But true lovers know no shame

Need to see your face

I need to see your face

I'm your guardian

Your twisted angel

The open arms

That were right behind you when you fell

Know you'll understand

One day you'll take my hand

Hit ya like a waterfall

I told you I'd be watching you

Waterfalls

Waterfalls

You belong to me

You will belong to me

Waterfalls

You belong to me

You will belong to me

In everything that you do

But don't worry now cause I'll take care of you

Mmm mmm mm

Mmm mmm mm

Hit ya like a waterfall

        by rummyjulia
