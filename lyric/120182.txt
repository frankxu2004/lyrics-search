Westlife - She's Back

EDIT BY snowcat  QQ:254009897

Shane:Took some time to heal

To get my heartbeat back

Just when I'm ahead

Returning from the dead

She's back again... Aha

She knows just what to say

She always gets her way

Just when I was free

She's back inside of me

She's back again

Mark (All)So tell me why the hell I hear music

Every time she calls I hear music

Is it just the way she loves to confuse me

Oh baby, ooooh

Just when I moved on

Believed that she was gone

She's back again... she's back

She's back again... she's back

Shane:Like a predator and prey

She'll tear my heart away

She'll chew me to the bone

Leave me rotting here alone

'Till she's back again

Mark (All)So tell me why the hell I hear music

Every time she calls I hear music

Is it just the way she loves to confuse me

Oh baby, ooooh

Just when I moved on

Believed that she was gone

ooooh, She's back again...she's back

ooooh, She's back again...she's back....

Mark (All):So tell me why the hell I hear music

Every time she calls I hear music

Is it just the way she loves to confuse me

Oh baby, ooooh

Just when I moved on

Believed that she was gone

She's back ,oh yeah

Every time she calls I hear music

Is it just the way she loves to confuse me

Oh baby, ooooh

Just when I moved on

Believed that she was gone

She's back again...oooh, she's back...
