2Pac feat Elton John - Ghetto Gospel

YAMAZKI制作

Uhh,  Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)

I welcome with my hands

And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold

And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

If I could recelect before my hood dayz

I'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on that good dayz

i stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em

They tested, it was stressed that fate under

In our days, things changed

Everyone's ashamed to the youth cuz the truth looks strange

And for me it's the worst, we left of a world that's cursed, and it hurts

cause any day they'll push the button

and yall condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin

Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary

but when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly

there's no need for you to fear me

if you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me

it aint about black or white, cuz we're human

I hope you see the light before its ruined

my ghetto gospel

Tell me do you see that old lady aint it sad

Living out a bag, plus she's glad for the little things she has

And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy

Guess she's given birth to a baby

I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan

We're jumping to another form of slavery

Even now I keep discouraged

Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage

I refuse to be a role model

I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle

I make mistakes, I learn from everyone

And when its said and done

I bet this Brotha be a better one

If I'm upset, you don't stress

Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet

I feel his hand on my brain

When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang

But am I less holy

Cuz I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies

Before we find world peace

We gotta find peace in that war on the streets

My ghetto gospel

Lord can you hear me speak!!

To pay the price of being hell bound...

To pay the price of being hell bound...
