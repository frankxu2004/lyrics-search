Now I can tell you about success,

about fame

About the rise and the fall

of all the stars in the sky

Don't it make you smile?

That it will be

Just Let it be

Won't you let it be

Now I can tell you about the place I belong

You know it won't last long

And all those lights they will turn down

That it will be

Oh~Let it be

Just let it will be

Won't you let it be?

Now I can see things for what they

really are

I guess I'm not that far

I'm at the point of no return

Just watch me burn

That it will be

Just let it will be

Oh let it be

Then it will be

(Just let it be)

Just let it be

(That it will be)

Oh let it be

(Won't you let it be)

Let it be

(Won't you let it be)

Now I can tell you the place that I belong

It won't last long

The lights, they will turn down

Oh let it be

Oh let it be

Oh let it be

(Won't you let it be)

Oh let it be

(You've got to let it be)

Just let it be

(Anyone can see)

Won't you let it be

(That it will be)

Just watch me go

Oh let it be

Just let it be

Won't you let it be

Won't you let it be

(Just let it be)

Oh let it be

(Let it be)

Just let it be

(Won't you let it be)

Won't you let it be

(Won't you let it be)

Won't you let it be

Now I can tell you

(Won't)

Tell you tell you...

(Just let it be)

About success, about fame

About fame, about fame

About fame

Won't you let it be

Just let it be

Won't you let it be

Won't you let it be
