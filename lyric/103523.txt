How Am I Supposed To Live Without You

I could hardly believe it

When I heard the news today

I had to come and get it straight from you

They said you were leavin'

Someone swept you heart away

From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'

Tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you

Now that I've been lovin' you so long

How am I supposed to live without you

How am I supposed to carry on

When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I didn't come here for cryin'

Didn't come here to breakdown

It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end

And how can I blame you

When I built my world around

The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends

And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming

Even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you

Now that I've been lovin' you so long

How am I supposed to live without you

How am I supposed to carry on

When all that I've been livin' for is gone

No I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming

Now that your dream has come true

Now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you

Now that I've been lovin' you so long

How am I supposed to live without you

How am I supposed to carry on

When all that I've been livin' for is gone
