Brand New Day

From the album ~Brand New Day~

Words and music by Sting

How many of you people out there

Been hurt in some kind of love affair?

And how many times did you swear

That you'd never love again?

How many lonely, sleepless nights?

How many lies, how many fights?

And why would you want to

Put yourself through all of that again?

"Love is pain," I hear you say

Love has a cruel and bitter way of

Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain

How could it be that what you need the most

Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?

You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking

Through an old book in rainy weather

You see a picture of her smiling at you

When you were still together

Or you could be walking down the street

And who should you chance to meet

But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?

Why don't we turn the clock to zero, honey

I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money

We're starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock all the way back

I wonder if she'll take me back

I'm thinking in a brand new way

Turn the clock to zero, sister

You'll never know how much I missed her

I'm starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero, boss

The river's wide, we'll swim across

We're starting up a brand new day

It could happen to you,

Just like it happened to me,

There's simply no immunity

There's no guarantee.

I say love's such a force if you find yourself in it

You need some time for reflection

You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute

Wait a minute, wait a minute

 Wait a minute, wait a minute

Turn the clock to zero, honey

I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money

We're starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero, Mac

I'm begging her to take me back

I'm thinking in a brand new way

Turn the clock to zero, boss

The river's wide, we'll swim across

We're starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock to zero buddy

Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy

Started up a brand new day

I'm the rhythm in your tune

I'm the sun and you're the moon

I'm the bat and you're the cave

You're the beach and I'm the wave

I'm the plow and you're the land

You're the glove and I'm the hand

I'm the train and you're the station

I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah

I'm the present to your future

You're the wound and I'm the suture

You're the magnet to my pole

I'm the devil in your soul

You're the pupil I'm the teacher

You're the church and I'm the preacher

You're the flower I'm the rain

 You're the tunnel I'm the train

Stand up all you lovers in the world

Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl

Stand up all you lovers in the world

Starting up a brand new day

You're the crop to my rotation

You're the sum of my equation

I'm the answer to your question

If you follow my suggestion

We can turn this ship around

We'll go up instead of down

You're the pan and I'm the handle

You're the flame and I'm the candle

Stand up all you lovers in the world

...  brand new day  ...

...  brand new day  ...
