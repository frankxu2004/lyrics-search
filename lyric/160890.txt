Sugar Oh, honey honey.

You are my candy boy.

And you've got me waiting you.

Honey Oh,

And you 've got me waiting you.

I just can't believe.

The loveliness of loving you.

The one I love can feel it too.

And you've got me waiting you.

When I kissed you,

Boy I know how sweet a kiss could be.

Like the silver sunshine.

Pour your sweetness over me
