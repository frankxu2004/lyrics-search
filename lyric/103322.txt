A SPACEMAN CAME TRAVELLING

CHIRS DE BURGH

°北极星制作

A spaceman came traveling on his ship from afar

'Twas light years of time since his mission did start

And over a village he halted his craft

And it hung in the sky like a star

Just like a star -----

He followed a light and came down to a shed

Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed

A bright light of silver shone round his head

And he had the face of an angel

And they were afraid -----

Then the stranger spoke

He said" Do not fear

I come from a planet a long way from here

And I bring a message for mankind to hear"

And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air ----

And it went la la ------

Peace and goodwill to all men

And love for the child ------

la la ------

This lovely music went trembling through the ground

And many were wakened on hearing that sound

And travelers on the road

The village they found by the light of that ship in the sky

Which shone all around -----

And just before dawn

At the paling of the sky

The stranger returned and said " Now I must fly

When two thousand years of your time has gone by

This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry --"

And it went la la ------

Peace and goodwill to all men

And love for the child ----

Oh the whole world is waiting

Waiting to hear the song again

There are thousands standing on the edge of the world

And a star is moving somewhere

And a star is moving somewhere
