Lucy Liu...

with my girl, Drew...

Cameron D. and Destiny

Charlie's Angels, Come on

Uh uh uh

Question: Tell me what you think about me

I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings

Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely

When it's all over please get up and leave

Question: Tell me how you feel about this

Try to control me boy you get dismissed

Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills

Always 50/50 in relationships

The shoes on my feet

I've bought it

The clothes I'm wearing

I've bought it

The rock I'm rockin'

I've bought it

'Cause I depend on me

If I wanted the watch you're wearin'

I'll buy it

The house I live in

I've bought it

The car I'm driving

I've bought it

I depend on me

(I depend on me)

All the women who are independent

Throw your hands up at me

All the honeys who makin' money

Throw your hands up at me

All the mommas who profit dollas

Throw your hands up at me

All the ladies who truly feel me

Throw your hands up at me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Tell me how you feel about this

Who would I want if I would wanna live

I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get

Ladies, it ain't easy bein' independent

Question: How'd you like this knowledge that I brought

Braggin' on that cash that he gave you is to front

If you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt

Depend on noone else to give you what you want

The shoes on my feet

I've bought it

The clothes I'm wearing

I've bought it

The rock I'm rockin'

I've bought it

'Cause I depend on me

If I wanted the watch you're wearin'

I'll buy it

The house I live in

I've bought it

The car I'm driving

I've bought it

I depend on me

(I depend on me)

All the women who are independent

Throw your hands up at me

All the honeys who makin' money

Throw your hands up at me

All the mommas who profit dollas

Throw your hands up at me

All the ladies who truly feel me

Throw your hands up at me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Destiny's Child

Wassup?

You in the house?

Sure 'nuff

We'll break these people off Angel style

Child of Destiny

Independent beauty

Noone else can scare me

Charlie's Angels

Woah

All the women who are independent

Throw your hands up at me

All the honeys who makin' money

Throw your hands up at me

All the mommas who profit dollas

Throw your hand

All the ladies who truly feel me

Throw your hands up at me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that

Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

END
