Westlife - In This Life

For all I've been blessed with in this life

There was an emptiness in me

I was imprisoned by the power of gold

With one honest touch you set me free

Let the world stop turning

Let the sun stop burning

Let them tell me love's not worth going through

If it all falls apart

I will know deep in my heart

The only dream that mattered had come true

In this life, I was loved by you

For every mountain I have climbed

And ever raging river crossed

You were the treasure that I longed to find

Without you love I would be lost

Let the world stop turning

Let the sun stop burning

Let them tell me love's not worth going through

If it all falls apart

I will know deep in my heart

The only dream that mattered had come true

In this life, I was loved by you

Let the world stop turning

Let the sun stop burning

Let them tell me love's not worth going through

If it all falls apart

I will know deep in my heart

The only dream that mattered had come true

In this life, I was loved by you

In this life, I was loved by you
