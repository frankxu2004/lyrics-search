Nu Virgos - Stop Stop Stop 

No I didn't trust him But he rushed me to feel 

Tried me mesmerize to me With his all sex appeal

Told me everything That I was longing to hear 

Shine and handsome My souvenir

And then all of sudden I have fallen in love

He would put me down But I still place him above

Tired of searching for the love That still lives in him 

Given my everything Like a souvenir

Given up my heart In the name of the memory

Fallen down like rain He could feel every drop 

Now I know have Have the courage to tell him

Tell him to stop!stop!stop! 

Given up my heart In the name of the memory

Fallen down like rain He could taste every drop 

Now I know have Have the courage to tell him

Tell him to stop!stop!stop

I become invisible I melt away at night 

Dreams for once so colorful Become black and white

Loving once so wonderful Is no longer here

So I keep this feeling Like a souvenir

Given up my heart In the name of the memory

Fallen down like rain He could feel every drop 

Now I know have Have the courage to tell him

Tell him to stop!stop!stop!

Given up my heart In the name of the memory

Fallen down like rain He could feel every drop 

Now I know have Have the courage to tell him

Tell him to stop!stop!stop!

Given up my heart In the name of the memory

Fallen down like rain He could feel every drop 

Now I know have Have the courage to tell him

Tell him to stop!stop!stop!

Given up my heart In the name of the memory

Fallen down like rain He could feel every drop 

Now I know have Have the courage to tell him

Tell him to stop!stop!stop!

stop!stop!stop!

stop!stop!stop!
