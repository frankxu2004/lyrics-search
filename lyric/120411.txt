I don't like cities,

but I like New York

Other places make me feel like a dork

Los Angeles is for people who sleep

Paris and London,

baby you can keep

Baby you can keep (8x)

Other cities always make me mad

Other places always make me sad

No other city ever made me glad

Except New York

I love New York

I love New York

I love New York

If you don't like my attitude,

Then you can F-off

Just go to Texas,

isn't that where they golf?

New York is not for little pussies

who scream

If you can't stand the heat,

then get off my street

Get off my street (8x)

Other cities always make me mad

Other places always make me sad

No other city ever made me glad

Except New York

I love New York

I love New York

I love New York

I love New York

(Get off my street, get off my street) (4x)

(Get off my street) (10x)

(Get off my street) (10x)
