Self Control

主唱：Laura Braniga

Oh the night is my world

City light painted girl

In the day nothing matters

It's the night time that flatters

In the night no control

Through the wall something breaking

Wearing white as you're walking

Down the street of my soul

You take my self you take my self control

You got me living only for the night

Before the morning comes the story's told

You take my self you take my self control

Another night another day goes by

I never stop myself to wonder why

You help me to forget to play my role

You take my self you take my self control

I I live among the creatures of the night

I haven't got the will to try and fight

Against a new tomorrow so I guess

I'll just believe it

That tomorrow never comes

A safe night I'm living in the forest of my dream

I know the night is not as it would seem

I must believe in something

So I'll make myself believe it

That this night will never go

Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Oh the night is my world

City light painted girl

In the day nothing matters

It's the night time that flatters

I I live among the creatures of the night

I haven't got the will to try and fight

Against a new tomorrow so I guess

I'll just believe it

That tomorrow never comes

A safe night I'm living in the forest of my dream

I know the night is not as it would seem

I must believe in something

So I'll make myself believe it

That this night will never go

Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

You take my self you take my self control

You take my self you take my self control

You take my self you take my self control
