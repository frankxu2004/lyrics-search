We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

Buddy you're a boy

Make a big noise Playing in the street

Gonna be a big man some day

You got blood on your face, ya big disgrace

Kicking your can all over the place (Singing)

We will, we will rock U (Ha)

We will, we will rock U (Ha ha)

Keep the beat up, why,

I'm gonna turn your heat up

Gonna get you on the floor,

gonna burn your feet up,

ah Rocking U, like I've never rocked U before

Like the way I do,

got your screaming for more

We causing utter devastation When we're stepping to the place

And better believe that you can see

We gonna rock and never stop

And here we go again

Hit you with the flow again

Kick it up the second time around

We bring it on again, shout it out

We will, we will rock U (we gonna rock, gonna rock ya baby)

We will, we will rock U (we gonna rock, gonna rock ya )

We will, we will rock U (we gonna rock, we gonna rock, gonna rock ya baby)

We will, we will rock U (Take a rest)

We will, we will rock U (Take a rest)

Buddy you're a boy

Make a big noise Playing in the street

Gonna be a big man some day

You got blood on your face, ya big disgrace

Kicking your can all over the place (Singing)

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U

We will, we will rock U
