Don't pretend you're sorry

I know you're not

You know you got the power

To make me weak inside

Girl you leave me breathless

But it's okay 'cause

You are my survival

Now hear me say

I can't imagine life

Without your love

Even forever don't seem

Like long enough

'Cause everytime I breathe

I take you in

And my heart beats again

Baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning in your love

Everytime I try to rise above

I'm swept away by love

Baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning in your love

Maybe I'm a drifter

Late at night

'Cause I long for the safety

Of flowing freely

In your arms

I don't need another lover

It's not for me

'Cause only you can save me

Oh can't you see

I can't imagine life

Without your love

And even forever don't seem

Like long enough

'Cause everytime I breathe

I take you in

And my heart beats again

Baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning in your love

Everytime I try to rise above

I'm swept away by love

Baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning in your love

Go on and pull me under

Cover me with dreams, yeah

Love me mouth to mouth now

You know I can't resist

'Cause you're the air

That I breathe

Everytime I breathe

I take you in

And my heart beats again

Baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning in your love

Everytime I try to rise above

I'm swept away by love

And baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning your love

Baby I can't help it

Keep me drowning

In your love

I keep drowning

In your love

Baby I can't help it

Can't help it no, no

'Cause everytime I breathe

I take you in

And my heart beats again

Baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning in your love

Everytime I try to rise above

I'm swept away by love

Baby I can't help it

You keep me

Drowning in your love

Drowning in your love
