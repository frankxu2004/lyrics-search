05.Goodbye

OC：David Foster / Linda Thompson

编：谢国维

监：伍乐城＠RNLS

I can see the pain living in your eyes

And I know how hard you try

You deserve to have so much more

I can feel your heart and I sympathize

And I'll never criticize all you've ever meant to my life

I don't want to let you down

I don't want to lead you on

I don't want to hold you back

From where you might belong

You would never ask me why

My heart is so disguised

I just can't live a lie anymore

I would rather hurt myself

Than to ever make you cry

There's nothing left to say but good-bye

You deserve the chance at the kind of love

I'm not sure I'm worthy of

Losing you is painful to me

I don't want to let you down

I don't want to lead you on

I don't want to hold you back

From where you might belong

You would never ask me why

My heart is so disguised

I just can't live a lie anymore

I would rather hurt myself

Than to ever make you cry

There's nothing left to say but good-bye

You would never ask me why

My heart is so disguised

I just can't live a lie anymore

I would rather hurt myself

Than to ever make you cry

There's nothing left to try

Through it's gonna hurt us both

THere's no other way than to say good-bye

THere's no other way than to say good-bye

05.Goodbye
