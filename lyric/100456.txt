Cruel to the eye

I see the way he makes you smile

Cruel to the eye

Watching him hold what used to be mine

Why did I lie?

What did I walk away to find

Ooohhh - why.....oooh - why....

I.........can't breathe easy

Can't sleep at night

Till you're by my side

No I............can't breathe easy

I can't dream yet another dream

Without you lying next to me

There's no air

Curse me inside

For every word that caused you to cry

Curse me inside

I won't forget, no i won't baby,

I don't know why (don't know why)

I left the one I was looking to find

Ooh - why....ooooh, why - whyyy....

Why

I.........can't breathe easy

Can't sleep at night

Till you're by my side

No I............can't breathe easy

I can't dream yet another dream

Without you lying next to me

There's no air

No I............can't breathe easy

I can't dream yet another dream

Without you lying next to me

There's no air

Out of my mind

Nothing makes sense anymore

I want you back in my life

That's all I'm breathing for

Ooooooohhhhh - tell me why

Oh won't you tell me why

I can't dream yet another dream

Without you lying next to me

There's no air

No, no, no

I.........can't breathe easy

Can't sleep at night

Till you're by my side

No I............can't breathe easy

I can't dream yet another dream

Without you lying next to me

There's no air

There's no air

END
