专辑：speak

Disconnected

Sleeping awake and awake when I′m sleeping

I′ve gotta try kinda first when drenched

All sunny days all I can see is the shadow

and I′m not above being under

And I′m at the brink though I know that I′m empty

and I always hide when its my turn to see

my only believe is not to have faith in believing

before I begin I′m over

Broken off again

and I′m only not lonely when I′m lonely by myself

Now the pain again I always let try forward

cuz all I know I′m Disconnected

Quietly loud while I′m noisily silent

keep holding my breath when I′m trying to breath

swimming against all of the waves and the rapids

I only win when I′m losing

Broken off again

and I′m only not lonely when I′m lonely by myself

Now the pain again I always let try forward

cuz all I know I′m Disconnected

I just wanna live my life sedated

Cuz I love driving myself away

Despite you know you say don′t give a damn

I can′t comprehend what I understand

Disconnected

Now the pain again I always let try forward

cuz all I know I′m Disconnected

and I′m only not lonely when I′m lonely by myself

Now the pain again I always let try forward

cuz all I know I′m Disconnected

cuz all I know I′m Disconnected
