Is that someone you used to date

Why she's hanging around here,

what's her story

Doesn't she know that its too late

That the party is over and the car is for me

Why dont u tell her what's been going on

Cuz she seems to be dreaming instead of just leaving

If you don't have the heart to fill her in

Then just step aside and let me lay it on the line

Cuz your mine (your mine)

And tonight you dont revolve around her

your mine (your mine)

and this time I'm gonna scream a little louder

Dont wanna be like

every other girl in the world

like every other one who wants you

Cuz when I see you something inside me burns

and then I realize I wanna come first

I wanna come first

I wanna come first

You look at me and I just die

Its like heaven arriving in my mind

and I cant believe all this jealousy

I used to be a girl who could let a guy breathe

But your mine (your mine)

And tonight you revolve around me

your mine (your mine)

and this time I'm gonna get a little louder

Don't wanna be like

every other girl in the world

like every other one who wants you

Cuz when I see you something inside me burns

and then I realize I wanna come first

I wanna come first

I wanna come first

Dont wanna be like every girl who's tried to get you

I wanna be the one who's never sorry that she met you

I wanna come first

I wanna come first

Hey!

Don't wanna be like

every other girl in the world

like every other one who wants you

Cuz when I see you something inside me burns

and then I realize I wanna come first

Don't wanna be like

every other girl in the world

like every other one who wants you

Cuz when I see you something inside me burns

and then I realize I wanna come first

I wanna come first

every other girl in the world

like every other one who wants you

Cuz when I see you something inside me burns

and then I realize I wanna come first

and then I realize I wanna come first
