You are my best friend,

And I love you.

You were always there to love me.

When I didn't even love myself,

You bring out the best in me,

And I thank you.

Thank you for my life thanks for your advice,

Your wisdom and your strength.

My earth angel

Thank you I'm so grateful

For trusting me and loving me

With your love unconditionally.

My earth angel,

Thank you I'm so grateful,

For trusting me and loving me,

With your love unconditionally.

You are my messenger,

From heaven.

No matter how unhappy I become,

You always find a way to make me smile.

And I admire you,

For your pure heart.

You're always giving all of you to,

Everyone around you and I pray we never part.

My earth angel,

Thank you I'm so grateful,

For trusting me and loving me,

With your love unconditionally.

And if it wasn't for you,

And if I didn't know you,

And if you never reached me,

And if you didn't teach me,

I wouldn't be who I am right now,

I wouldn't give what I give right now,

I wouldn't think what I think right now.

I'm thanking you I'm thanking you

My earth angel,

Thank you I'm so grateful,

For you trusting me and loving me,

With your love unconditionally.

For you trusting me and loving me,

With your love unconditionally.

My earth angel,

Thank you I'm so grateful,

For you trusting me and loving me,

With your love unconditionally.
