(Oh baby baby)

(Oh baby baby)

Oh baby baby

How was I supposed to know

that something wasn't right here

Oh baby baby

I shouldn't have let you go

and now you're out of sight yeah

Show me how you want it to be

tell me baby

cause I need to know now

oh because

My loneliness is killing me

(and I)

I must confess

I still believe

(still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

give me a sign

hit me baby one more time

Oh baby baby

The reason I breathe is you

Boy you've got me blinded

Oh pretty baby

There's nothing that I wouldn't do

It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be

tell me baby

cause I need to know now

oh because

My loneliness is killing me

(and I)

I must confess

I still believe

(still believe)

when I'm not with you I lose my mind

give me a sign

hit me baby one more time

(Oh baby baby)

(Oh baby baby)

Oh baby baby

How was I supposed to know

Oh pretty baby

I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess

that my loneliness

is killing me now

Don't you know I still believe

that you will be here

and give me a sign

hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me

(and I)

I must confess

I still believe

(still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

give me a sign

hit me baby

I must confess

that my loneliness

is killing me now

Don't you know

I still believe

that you will be here

and give me a sign

hit me baby one more time

hit me baby one more time
