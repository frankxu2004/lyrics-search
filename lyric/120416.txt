There's only so much you can learn in one place

The more that I wait, the more time that I waste

I haven't got much time to waste

It's time to make my way

I'm not afraid I'll face

But I'm afraid to stay

I'm going down my own road

And I can make it alone

All work and no fighting

I'll find a place of my own

Are you ready to jump?

Get ready to jump

Don't ever look back, oh baby

Yes, I'm ready to jump

Just take my hands

Get ready to jump

We learned our lesson from the start,

my sisters and me

The only thing you can

depend on is your family

And life's gonna drop you down

like the limbs of a tree

It sways and it swings and it bends until it

makes you see

Are you ready to jump?

Get ready to jump

Don't ever look back, oh baby

Yes, I'm ready to jump

Just take my hands

Get ready to, are you ready?

There's only so much you can learn in one place

The more that you wait,

the more time that you waste

All work and no fighting,

I'll find a place of my own

It sways and it swings and it bends until you

make it your own

I can make alone (7x)

Are you ready to jump?

Get ready to jump

Don't ever look back, oh baby

Yes, I'm ready to jump

Just take my hands

Get ready to jump

Are you ready to jump?

Get ready to jump

Don't ever look back, oh baby

Yes, I'm ready to jump

Just take my hands

Get ready to, are you ready?

Get ready to, are you ready?
