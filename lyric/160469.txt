Loneliness is the price I paid

for having loved you Stuck by you

Crying my eyes our everynight I prayed

To see you back and call me a fool

Happiness is what I gave awa

For having loved you stuck by you

Drying my eyes I would wait for you

to take me back in yourarms again

I don't care if you have someone

On the dark side of your mind

I only need you to love me like before

I don't care if you have someone

On the dark side of your mind

Just let me be the one you'll kiss tonight

Happiness is what I gave awa

For having loved you stuck by you

Drying my eyes I would wait for you

to take me back in yourarms again

I don't care if you have someone

On the dark side of your mind

I only need you to love me like before

I don't care if you have someone

On the dark side of your mind

Just let me be the one you'll kiss tonight

Just let me be the one you'll kiss tonight
