Early mornin’

alright now

I was out a little late last night

Got a little messy

Can’t be like that anymore

No…

I was shaking my ass in the streets and moving

Just walked in and it’s early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Passed out on my couch and yawning

Just walked in, it was early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Met a tall dude, Kinda dark hair

When he walked up somebody grabbed him

But I liked him, told him “come here”

Kinda cool

Baby, we can make plans

Where ya live

Do ya mama live there?

We can hook up at the hotel

He was down

So I told him, let’s go

What happened next? Guess…

But, you don’t wanna know

I was shaking my ass in the streets and moving

Just walked in and it’s early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Passed out on my couch and yawning

Just walked in, it was early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Oh, I went out and I approached him

But we couldn’t get with his friends

There’s something ‘bout him moving slow

So I said “what the hell, let’s go”

Got up

Got on the dance floor

Hooked up with a guy named Joe

When the music was fast and slow

What happened next? Guess…

But, you don’t wanna know

I was shaking my ass in the streets and moving

Just walked in and it’s early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Passed out on my couch and yawning

Just walked in, it was early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Call all your boys

Call all your girls

Call all your friends

Let’s do it again

Let’s do it again

Yes, Early morning

Yes, Can’t keep doin’ this

I light your fire, Your one desire

Pull on me, baby and I’ll take you higher

You should try it, so come over here and let’s go so

I was shaking my ass in the streets and moving

Just walked in and it’s early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Passed out on my couch and yawning

Just walked in, it was early morning

Got drunk till the break of dawn

And it don’t stop till the early morning

Call all your boys

Call all your girls

Call all your friends

Let’s do it again

Let’s do it

Early mornin’

Early mornin’
