专辑：speak

To Know Your Name

I know your name

But I won′t tell

We must keep this secret well

Drive the sleeves

Hard to find

Eyes are watching all the time

Everybody wants to know my love

Everybody talks about my love

Everybody want′s to know your name

to know your name

everybody needs to criticize

None of them are even in our lives

Everybody wants to know your name

to know your name

can′t get out can′t get through

need to be alone with you

must escape or are we allowed no guard I drive to see

Everybody wants to know my love

Everybody talks about my love

Everybody want′s to know your name

to know your name

everybody needs to criticize

None of them are even in our lives

Everybody wants to know your name

to know your name

Can the boys with the zoom give the girls just second

see the man that I love needs a little sweet attention

I don′t want to seem harsh but this girl′s under pressure

I can't go through losing love again

Boy I need to breathe just one breath

was our closing in so fast

Hard to find as are watching all the time

Hard to find as are watching all the time

Everybody wants to know my love

Everybody talks about my love

Everybody want′s to know your name

to know your name

everybody needs to criticize

None of them are even in our lives

Everybody wants to know your name

to know your name

Everybody wants to know my love

Everybody talks about my love

Everybody want′s to know your name

to know your name

everybody needs to criticize

None of them are even in our lives

Everybody wants to know your name

to know your name
