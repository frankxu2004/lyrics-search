Mickey（精神）

歌手：Toni Basil

(A-No.15)

Oh Mickey, you're so fine

you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey)

(Oh Mickey, you're so fine

you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey)

(Oh Mickey, you're so fine

you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey)

Hey Mickey!

You've been around all night and that's a little long

You think you've got the right but I think you've got it wrong

Why can't you say goodnight so you can take me home, Mickey

'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't

You're givin' me the chills, baby, please baby don't

Every night you still leave me all alone, Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand

You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand

Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand

It's guys like you Mickey

Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey

Don't break my heart, Mickey

Hey Mickey!

Now when you take me by the who's ever gonna know

Everytime you move gonna show

There's somethin' we can use, so don't say no, Mickey

So come on and give it to me any way you can

Any way you wanna do it, I'll treat you like a man

Oh please, baby, please, don't leave me in a jam, Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand

You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand

Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand

It's guys like you Mickey

Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey

Don't break my heart, Mickey

(Oh Mickey, you're so fine

you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey)

(Oh Mickey, you're so fine

you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey)

(Oh Mickey, you're so fine

you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey)

Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand

You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand

Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand

It's guys like you Mickey

Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey

Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand

You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand

Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand

It's guys like you Mickey

Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey

Don't break my heart, Mickey

Don't break my heart, Mickey
