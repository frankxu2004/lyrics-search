Westlife - Heart Without A Home

Girl I love to watch you

You're like candy to my eyes

Like a movie that you've seen

But you gotta watch just one more time

But that smile you're wearing

It's a beautiful disguise

It's just something you put on to hide the emptiness inside

And you seem so lonely

But you don't have to anymore..

If you're a heart without a home

Rebel without a cause

If you feel as though

You're always stranded on the shore

Like a thief in the night

Let me steal your heart away

Baby if for reasons, what you're looking for

I'll be yours

I'll be yours

I'll be a new sensation

One you never had before

I got a feeling if I gave you some

You'd probably want some more

Did you know that Baby

You're the bluebird in my sky

I only wanna make you happy cause

I love to see you fly

And if you feel lonely

You don't have to anymore

If you're a heart without a home

Rebel without a cause

If you feel as though

You're always stranded on the shore

Like a thief in the night

Let me steal your heart away

Baby if for reasons, what you're looking for

I'll be yours

I'll be yours, I'll be yours

I'll be the raft in the tide

I'll be yours

I'll be the truth in the light

And what's more

When no one opens the door

I'll be the hope that you're looking for

If you're a heart without a home

Rebel without a cause

If you feel as though

You're always stranded on the shore

Like a thief in the night

Let me steal your heart away

Baby if for reasons, what you're looking for

If you're a heart without a home

Rebel without a cause

If you feel as though

You're always stranded on the shore

Like a thief in the night

Let me steal your heart away

Baby if for reasons, what you're looking for

I'll be yours

I'll be yours...
