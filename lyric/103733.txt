Hilary Duff - Girl Can Rock (Remix 2005)

Album: Most Wanted

Editor: FlowerSpider (QQ 1878886 ICQ 151476238)

Ready for the big time

Ready for the small

Whatever's comin' to me

I'll be ready for it all

Sometimes it ain't easy

Sometimes its not polite

Some days I don't get it

Some days I get it right

It's in my heart

It's in my head

Thats what I said

Hey Boys, are you ready for the shock

I'm living proof

The girls can rock

Spread the new around every single block

Hey boys, the girl can rock

Standin' in the spotlight workin' up a sweat

Givin' all I got and lovin' what I get

I can't hold back what I feel inside

And if I make you nervous

You better stop aside

It's in my heart

It's in my head

Thats what I said

Hey Boys, are you ready for the shock

I'm living proof

The girls can rock

Spread the new around every single block

Hey boys, the girl can rock

The girl can rock

Don't say maybe or call me 'baby'

I ain't crazy at all

It's in my heart

It's in my head

Thats what I said

Hey Boys, are you ready for the shock

I'm living proof

The girls can rock

Spread the new around every single block

Hey boys, the girl can rock

Hey Boys, are you ready for the shock

I'm living proof

The girls can rock

Spread the new around every single block

Hey boys, the girl can rock

I'm gonna live it up

I'll never give it up

I'm gonna spread the news around the block

It ain't no shock

The girl can rock

The girl can rock

The girl can rock

Yeah, Rock!
