Will Young - Evergreen

Eyes, like a sunrise

Like a rainfall

Down my soul

And I wonder,

I wonder why you look at me like that

What you're thinking,

What's behind

Don't tell me but it feels like love

I'm gonna take this moment

And make it last forever

I'm gonna give my heart away

And pray we'll stay together

'Cause you're the one good reason

You're the only girl that I need

'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen

I'm gonna take this night

And make it Evergreen

Touch, like an angel

Like velvet to my skin

And I wonder,

I wonder why you wanna stay the night

What you're dreaming

What's behind

Don't tell me but it feels like love

I'm gonna take this moment

And make it last forever

I'm gonna give my heart away

And pray we'll stay together

'Cause you're the one good reason

You're the only girl that I need

'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen

I'm gonna take this night

And make it Evergreen

(We can make it last forver more)

(Don't tell me, but it feels like love)

I'm gonna take this moment

And make it last forever

I'm gonna give my heart away

And pray we'll stay together

'Cause you're the one good reason

You're the only girl that I need

'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen

I'm gonna take this moment

And make it last forever

I'm gonna give my heart away

And pray we'll stay together

'Cause you're the one good reason

You're the only girl that I need

'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen

I'm gonna take this night

And make it Evergreen

And make it Evergreen

END
