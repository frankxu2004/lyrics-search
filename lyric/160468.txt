陈秋霞 - Kiss Me Goodbye

环球真经典系列之陈秋霞

------

We choose it, win or lose it

Love is never quite the same

I love you, now I've lost you

Don't feel bad, you're not to blame

So kiss me goodbye

and I'll try not to cry

All the tears in the world

won't change your mind

There's someone new and she's waiting for you

Soon your heart will be leaving me behind

Linger awhile, then I'll go with a smile

Like a friend who just happened to call

For the last time pretend your are mine

My darling, kiss me goodbye

----

I know now I must go now

Though my heart wants me to stay

That girl is your tomorrow

I belong to yesterday

I belong to yesterday

So kiss me goodbye

and I'll try not to cry

All the tears in the world

won't change your mind

There's someone new and she's waiting for you

Soon your heart will be leaving me behind

Linger awhile, then I'll go with a smile

Like a friend who just happened to call

For the last time pretend your are mine

My darling, kiss me goodbye

----

My darling, kiss me goodbye

----
