"If It Takes All Night"

BLUE

by:YOGA

You think i'm just coming on to you

I know exactly what i got to do

Your eyes kinda give the game away

I know exactly what your trying to say

But i'm not gonna give up

I'll prove to you i'm good enough

Just take your chance

I'll show you love

Put your trust in me girl

I'm not like the other guys

won't break your heart and tell you lies

Before you start to criticise put you trust in me girl.

If It takes all night

Gonna give my love to you

gonna get it right if it takes all night

If it takes all night

Gonna give it up to you

gonna get it right if it takes all night

I know all about the other kind

One thing playing on a one track mind

You'll see it's not the way it has to be

If you'll only give your love to me

But i'm not gonna give up

I'll prove to you i'm good enough

Just take your chance

I'll show you love

Put your trust in me girl

I'm not like the other guys

won't break your heart and tell you lies

Before you start to criticise put you trust in me girl.

If It takes all night

Gonna give my love to you

gonna get it right if it takes all night

If it takes up night

Gonna give it all to you

gonna get it right if it takes all night

Watching and waiting just anticipating

The moment you come in my life

Hoping and praying you hear what i'm saying tonight, oh tonight

If It takes all night

Gonna give my love to you, gonna get it right if it takes all night

If it takes all night

Gonna give it up to you

If It takes all night

Gonna give my love to you, gonna get it right if it takes all night

If it takes all night

Gonna give it up to you

If It takes all night

Gonna give my love to you, gonna get it right if it takes all night

If it takes all night

Gonna give it up to you, gonna get it right if it takes all night

If It takes all night

Gonna give my love to you...
