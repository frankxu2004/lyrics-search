Faith Hill - Santa Claus Is Comin To Town

You better watch out

You better not cry

You better not pout

I'm telling you why

Santa Claus

Is coming to town

He's making a list

He's checking it twice

He's gonna find out

Who's naughty or nice

Santa Claus

Is coming to town

He sees you

When you're sleeping

He knows

When you're awake

He knows

If you've been bad

Or good

So be good

For goodness sake

So you

Better watch out

You better not cry

You better not pout

I'm telling you why

Santa Claus

Is coming to town

Better watch out

You better not cry

You better not pout

I'm telling you why

Santa Claus

Is coming to town

He's making a list

He's checking it twice

He's gonna find out

Who's naughty or nice

Santa Claus

Is coming to town

He sees you

When you're sleeping

He knows

When you're awake

He knows

If you've been bad

Or good

So be good

For goodness sake

So you

Better watch out

You better not cry

You better not pout

I'm telling you why

Santa Claus

Is coming to town
