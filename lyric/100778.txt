Notice me

take my hand

Why are we

strangers when

Our love is strong

Why carry on without me

And everytime I try

to fly I fall without my wings

I feel so small

I guess I need you baby

And everytime I see

you in my dreams,I see your face

It's haunting me

I guess I need you baby

I make believe

That you are here

It's the only way

I see clear

What have I done

You seem to move on easy

And everytime I try

to fly I fall without my wings

I feel so small

I guess I need you baby

And everytime I see

you in my dreams,I see your face

you're haunting me

I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain

Please forgive me

My weakness caused you pain

And this song is my sorry

Ohhhh

At night I pray

That soon your face will fade away

And everytime I try

to fly I fall without my wings

I feel so small

I guess I need you baby

And everytime I see

you in my dreams

I see your face

It's haunting me

I guess I need you baby

And everytime I try

to fly I fall without my wings

I feel so small

I guess I need you baby

And everytime I see

you in my dreams

I see your face

It's haunting me

I guess I need you baby
