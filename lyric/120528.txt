Ashanti - Only U

Oooo, I can't wait to get next to you.

Ohhh, I just can't leave you alone.

Boy you got me doin' thangs that I would never do,

And I can't stop the way I'm feelin' if I wanted to.

I'm crazy bout the way that you could make me say your name,

And if I couldn't have you I would probably go insane 'cause…

(Only you can make me feel),

And only you can take me there

(Only you can take me there).

And only you can me feel

(Only you, only you can make me feel),

And only you can take me there

(Only you can take me there).

Oooo, I can't wait to get next to you.

Ohhh, I just can't leave you alone.

Boy you stay inside my mind, ain't no denyin' that.

And only you could do them things that got me comin' back.

You gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt.

And I'll do what I gotta do to keep you to myself 'cause…

Only you can make me feel

(Only you can make me feel, yeah),

And only you can take me there

(Only you can take me there, yeah).

And only you can me feel

(Only you can make me feel, yeah),

And only you can take me there

(Only you can take me there).

Crazy 'bout the way you feel.

I just gotta have you here and I wanna let you know,

I won't ever let you go.

Only you can make me feel

(Only you can make me feel),

And only you can take me there

(Only you can take me there, yeah).

And only you can me feel

(You can make me feel),

And only you can take me there

(Only you can take me there).

Oooo, I can't wait to get next to you...

Ohhh, I just can't leave you alone...
