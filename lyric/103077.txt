Hey y'all listen up!  It don't matter where I'm from

It don't matter if you care  I am who I am,

Iet me telling you I can be(you can be what?)

who I wanna be I don't give a damn of who you are

So don't you try ask about my name Life is simple to me,

I feel  xxxx boring Like I said,I can be (what?)

who I wannabe This is how way I think

You don't know me Don't mess around with me

Stay away from me This is how I walk

This is the way I do my thing You don't even know me Stop

messing around Now you hear me? Hey listen up loser!

It don't matter where I'm from It don't matter if you care

I am who I am,let me telling you I can be(you can be what?)

who I wanna be don't  give a damn of who you are

So don't you try ask about my name Life is simple to me,

I feel xxxx boring Like I said, I can be(what?)who I wanna be

I feel xxxx boring Like I said, I can be(what?)who I wanna be
