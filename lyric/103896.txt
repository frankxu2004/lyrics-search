i wrote every note that you sung 

fought every battle you won 

but i'm pulling out the nails of the cross you nailed me to 

cause i'll no longer be your shadow 

you didn't do this alone 

and it's time you should know 

i turned your bricks into a wall 

built the throne where you sat tall 

let you praise them like messiah 

while i wore your crown of thorns 

i turned your bricks into a wall 

built the throne where you sat tall 

let you praise them like messiah 

while i wore your crown of thorns 

you said the words but i wrote the poem 

enjoyed the warmth but i built the home 

but the grave that you dug wasn't deep enough for me 

now you wanna cast me aside 

well hey it's an eye for an eye 

and i won't be crusified 

i turned your bricks into a wall 

built the throne where you sat tall 

let you praise them like messiah 

while i wore your crown of thorns 

turned your bricks into a wall 

built the throne where you sat tall 

let you praise them like messiah 

while i wore your crown of thorns 

no more quiet woman behind her man 

waiting to correct another one of his mistakes 

an anonymous goddess behind her god 

parting the waters of the world before it gets too late 

well do you hear my gospel that you can't have 

you can write it yourself 

cause its not yours to take 

this time 

this time 

this time

I turned your bricks into a wall

I built the throne where you sat tall

I let them praise you like messiah

While I wore your crown of thorns

I turned your bricks into a wall

I built the th

I let them praise you like messiah

While I wore your crown of thorns

I turned your bricks into a wall

I built the throne where you sat tall

I let them praise you like messiah

While I wore your crown of thorns

I turned your bricks into a wall

I built the throne where you sat tall

I let them praise you like messiah

While I wore your crown

I let them praise you like messiah

While I wore your crown
