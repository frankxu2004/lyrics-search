What did you say

I know I saw you saying it

My ears won't stop ringing

Long enough to hear

Those sweet words

What did you say

And now the day

The hour hand has spun

Before the night is done

I just have to hear

Those sweet words

Spoken like a melody

All your love

Is a lost balloon

Rising up through the afternoon

'Til it could fit on the head of a pin

Come on in

Did you have a hard time sleeping

'Cause a heavy moon was keeping you awake

And all I know is I'm just glad to see you again

See my love

Like a lost balloon

Rising up through the afternoon

And then you appear

What did you say

I know I saw you saying it

My ears won't stop ringing

Long enough to hear

Those sweet words

And your simple melody

I just have to hear

Your sweet words

Spoken like a melody

I just wanna hear

Those sweet words
