Baby when we're grinding

I get so excited

Ooh, how I like it

I try but I can't fight it

Oh you're dancing real close

This way you're real slow

You're making it hard for me

All the slow songs you requested

You're dancing like you're naked

It's almost like we're sexing (oh yeah)

Yeah boo, I like it

You know I can't deny it

But I know you can tell I'm excited

Ooh girl

(Step back you're dancing kinda close

I feel a little flush coming through on you)

Now girl, I know you felt it

Before you know I can't help it

You know what I wanna do

Baby when we're grinding

I get so excited

Ooh, how I like it

I try but I can't fight it

Oh you're dancing real close

This way you're real slow

You're making it hard for me

Baby this dancin' so close

Ain't a good idea

'Cos I'ma want you now and here

The way that you shake it for me

Makes me want you so bad sexually

Oh, girl

(Step back you're dancing kinda close

I feel a little flush coming through on you)

Now girl, I know you felt it

Before you know I can't help it

You know what I wanna do

Baby when we're grinding

I get so excited

Ooh, how I like it

I try but I can't fight it

Oh you're dancing real close

This way you're real slow

You're making it hard for me

I love when you shake it like that, ah, ah, ah, ah

I see that you like it like that, ah, ah, ah

I love when you shake it like that, ah, ah, ah

I see that you like it like that, oh-oh

I see that you like it like that, oh-oh

Baby when we're grinding

I get so excited

Ooh, how I like it

I try but I can't fight it

Oh you're dancing real close

This way you're real slow

You're making it hard for me

Baby when we're grinding

I get so excited

Ooh, how I like it

I try but I can't fight it

Oh you're dancing real close

This way you're real slow

You're making it hard for me

Baby when we're grinding

I get so excited

Ooh, how I like it

I try but I can't fight it

Oh you're dancing real close

This way you're real slow

You're making it hard for me
