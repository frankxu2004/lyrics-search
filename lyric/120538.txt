[Verse One - Andre 3000]

My baby don't mess around

Because she loves me so

And this I know fo shooo..

Uh, But does she really wanna

But can't stand to see me

Walk ou the dooo..

Don't try to fight the feelin'

Because the thought alone is killing me right nooww..

Uh, thank god for mom and dad

For sticking through together

'Cause we don't know hooowww...
