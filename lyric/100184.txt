(Everything I Do) I Do It for You-Kenny G&LeAnn Rimes

Look into my eyes

you will see

What you mean to me

Search your heart

search your soul

And when you find me there

you'll search no more

Don't tell me

it's not worth trying for

You can't tell me

it's not worth dying for

You know it's true

Everything I do

I do it for you  OU

Look into my heart

you will find

There's nothing there to hide

Take me as I am

take my life

I would give it all

I would sacrifice

Don't tell me

it's not worth fighting for

I can't help it

there's nothing I want more

You know it's true

Everything I do

I do it for you  OU

There's no love

like your love

And no other

could give more love

There's nowhere

unless you're there

All the time

all the way yeah

Oh - you can't tell me

it's not worth trying for

I can't help it

there's nothing I want more

yeah...I would fight for you

I'd lie for you

Walk the wire for you

yeah... I'd die for you

You know it's true

Everything I do

ah...

I do it for you
