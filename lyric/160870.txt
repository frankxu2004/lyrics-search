Lies the seed that with the sun's love

In the spring

Becomes the rose

The Rose

蔡依林

词：Amanda Mcbroom 曲：Amanda Mcbroom

Some say love

It is a river that drowns the tender reed

Some say love

It is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love

It is a hunger an endless aching need

I say love

It is a flower and you it's only seed

It's the heart

Afraid of breaking that never learns to dance

It's the dream

Afraid of walking that never takes the chance

It's the one

who won't be taken who can't seem to give

And the soul

Afraid of dying that never learns to live

（Rap）

Life is a gift and you gotta learn to live

It if you believe in love

You gotta learn to give it

Tryin' to find someone who's kind is hard to do

You want the love but you really don't know what to do

You're just afraid of someone breaking your heart

You never learned to live you gave up from the start

You felt the pain but it made you strong

So remember no matter what you will go on

So remember no matter what you will go on

When the night has been too lonely

And the road has been too long

And you think

That love is only for the lucky and the strong

Just remember

In the winter for beneath the bitter snow

Lies the seed that with the sun's love

in the spring becomes the rose

Lies the seed that with the sun's love

in the spring becomes the rose
