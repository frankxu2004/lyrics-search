Forbidden Love

演唱：Madonna

Madonna-Forbidden Love

★ danfeng927制作

Just one kiss on my lips

was all it took to seal the future

Just one look from your eyes

was like a certain kind of torture

Once upon a time

there was a boy and there was a girl

Just one touch from your hands

was all it took to make me falter

Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Madonna-Forbidden Love

★ danfeng927制作

Just one smile on your face

was all it took to change my fortune

Just one word from your mouth

was all I needed to be certain

Once upon a time

there was a boy and there was a girl

Hearts that intertwine

they lived in a different kind of world

Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Madonna-Forbidden Love

★ danfeng927制作

Just one kiss, just one touch, just one look

Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever

Forbidden love, forbidden love

Just one kiss, just one touch

just one look, just one love

One

One
