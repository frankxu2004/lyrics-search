Baby, can't you see

I'm calling

A guy like you should wear a warning

It's dangerous

I'm falling

There's no escape

I can't wait

I need a hit

Baby, give me it

You're dangerous

I'm loving it

Tonight

Can't calm down

Losin' my head

Spinnin' 'round and 'round

Do you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips

I'm on a ride

Your toxic tongue slippin' mine (Ohh Ohh)

With the taste of the poison paradise

I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that your toxic?

And I love what you do

Don't you know that your toxic?

It's getting late to give you up

I took a sip from a devil's cup

Slowly, It's taking over me

Tonight

Can't calm down

It's in the air and it's all around

Can you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips

I'm on a ride

Your toxic tongue slippin' mine (Ohh Ohh)

With the taste of the poison paradise

I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that your toxic?

And I love what you do

Don't you know that your toxic?

Don't you know that your toxic?

With the taste of your lips

I'm on a ride

Your toxic tongue slippin' mine (Ohh Ohh)

With the taste of the poison paradise

I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that your toxic?

With the taste of your lips

I'm on a ride

Your toxic tongue slippin' mine (Ohh Ohh)

With the taste of the poison paradise

I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that your toxic?

Intoxicated now

With your lovin' now

I think I'm ready now

Intoxicated now

With your lovin' now

I think I'm ready now
