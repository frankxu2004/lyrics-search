Bizarre Love Triangle - Frente!

Every time I think of you

I get a shot right through

Into a bolt of blue

It's no problem of mine

But it's a problem I find

Living the life that I can't leave behind

There's no sense in telling me

The wisdom of a fool won't set you free

But that's the way that it goes

And it's what nobody knows

And every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling

I get down on my knees and pray

I'm waiting for the final moment

You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good

I feel like I never should

Whenever I get this way

I just don't know what to say

Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday

I'm not sure what this could mean

I don't think you're what you seem

I do admit to myself

That if I hurt someone else

Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling

I get down on my knees and pray

I'm waiting for the final moment

You'll say the words that I can't say

Every time I see you falling

I'll get down on my knees and pray

I'm waiting for the final moment

You'll say the words that I can't say
