Sweetbox-That Night

That night

That night

By your side

I cried

One night in late July

I saw you cross the room

Then you asked me for a dance

and I could hardly move (yeah)

I`d never been so scared before

your touch was overwhelming

Then you led me to the floor

and I swore I was dreaming

That night there was magic

That night I was spellbound

By your side oh the first time

I cried I cried Yes you changed my life

That night That night

By your side oh the first time

I cried I cried This night changed my life

We sat and talked all night

the starry sky above us

You were nervous I was shy

The butterflies of first love

Then I knocked on heaven`s door

when you leaned in to kiss me

I`d never been left wanting more

oh I was hardly breathing

That night there was magic

That night I was spellbound

By your side oh the first time

I cried I cried Yes you changed my life

That night That night

By your side oh the first time

I cried I cried This night changed my life

I want to have that night again

I wanna know what might have been

First love just never ends

oh why do I still miss him

Now life has distanced us

that summer night`s long gone

But I still feel your lips

when I hear our old love song

I`ve changed a lot since then

but I still sit and wonder

I`d like to know what might have been

if summer love had lingered

That night

That night

By your side

I cried

Yes you changed my life

That night I was spellbound

By your side oh the first time

I cried I cried Yes you changed my life

That night That night

By your side oh the first time

I cried I cried This night changed my life

That night That night

By your side oh the first time

I cried I cried This night changed my life

(End)

(End)
