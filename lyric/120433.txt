U2 - Yahweh

Album: How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb

Take these shoes

Click clacking down some dead end street

Take these shoes

And make them fit

Take this shirt

Polyester white trash made in nowhere

Take this shirt

And make it clean, clean

Take this soul

Stranded in some skin and bones

Take this soul

And make it sing

Yahweh, Yahweh

Always pain before a child is born

Yahweh, Yahweh

Still I'm waiting for the dawn

Take these hands

Teach them what to carry

Take these hands

Don't make a fist

Take this mouth

So quick to criticise

Take this mouth

Give it a kiss

Yahweh, Yahweh

Always pain before a child is born

Yahweh, Yahweh

Still I'm waiting for the dawn

Still waiting for the dawn, the sun is coming up

The sun is coming up on the ocean

This love is like a drop in the ocean

This love is like a drop in the ocean

Yahweh, Yahweh

Always pain before a child is born

Yahweh, tell me now

Why the dark before the dawn?

Take this city

A city should be shining on a hill

Take this city

If it be your will

What no man can own, no man can take

Take this heart

Take this heart

Take this heart

And make it break

END

END
