McFly - Obviously

Recently I've been

Hopelessly reachin'

Out for this girl

Who's out of this world

Believe me

She's got a boyfriend

He drives her 'round the bend

Cuz he's 23

He's in the marines

He'd kill me

Been so many nights now

I find myself thinkin about her now

Cause obviously she's out of my league

But how can I win

She keeps draggin me in

And I know I

Never will be good enough for her

No no

I never will be good enough for her

Got to escape now

Get on a plane now  Yeah

Off to LA

And that's where I'll stay

For two years

I'll put it behind me(I'll put it behind me)

And go to a place where she can't find me

Ohhh

Cause obviously she's out of my league

I'm wastin my time

Cause she'll never be mine

And I know I

Never will be good enough for her

No no

I never will be good enough for her

She's out of my hands

And I never know where I stand

Cause I'm not

Good enough for her

( Good enough for her, enough, enough, enough for her )

Good enough for her, good enough for her

Cause obviously she's out of my league

I'm wastin my time

Cause she'll never be mine

And I know I

Never will be good enough for her

Cause obviously she's out of my league

But how can I win

She keeps draggin me in

And I know I

Never will be good enough for her

Cause obviously she's out of my league

I'm wastin my time

Cause she'll ne-ver be mine

And I know I

Never will be good enough for her

No no

I never will be good enough for her
