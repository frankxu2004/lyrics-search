Sweetbox-Unforgiven

(Music)

Unforgiven...

Keep hittin my head on the wall

Cryin out but who hears my call

Walkin on the edge but don't fall

I just wanna loose my sense of self control

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose all control of this

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose

Unforgiven...

Can put these voices to sleep

I need to have more room to breath

Put my paranoia at ease

Oh I just wanna loose my sense of self control

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose all control of this

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose

Unforgiven...

(Music)

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose all control of this

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose all control of this

Input output overload too quick

Lookin for and searchin for climax to this

Screamin cryin am I slowly dyin

I'm about to loose

Unforgiven...
