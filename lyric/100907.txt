Vanessa Carlton - A Thousand Miles

Making my way down town

Walking fast

Faces pass

And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead

Just making my way

Making a way

Through the crowd

And I need you

And I miss you

And now I wonder

If I could fall

Into the sky

Do you think time

Would pass me by

Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles

If I could just see you... tonight

It's always times like these

When I think of you

And I wonder

If you ever think of me

Cause everything's so wrong

And I don't belong

Living in

Your precious memory

Cause I need you

And I miss you

And now I wonder

If I could fall

Into the sky

Do you think time

Would pass me by,oh

Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles

If I could just see you... tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know

I, I drown in your memory

I,I don't wanna let this go

I, I've fallen...

Making my way down town

Walking fast

Faces pass

And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead

Just making my way

Making a way

Through the crowd

And I still need you

And I still miss you

And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky

Do you think time, would pass us by

Cause you kow I'd walk a thousand miles

If I could just see you...

If I could fall into the sky

Do you think time would pass me by

Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles

If I could just see you...

If I could just hold you... tonight
