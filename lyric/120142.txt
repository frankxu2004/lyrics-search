City lights shine on the harbor

Night has fallen down

Through the darkness and the shadow

I will still go on

Long Long Journey

Through the darkness

Long Long way to go

But what are paths across the ocean to the heart that's coming home?

Where the road runs through the valley

Where the river flows

I will follow every highway

To the place I know

Long Long Journey

Through the darkness

Long Long way to go

But what are paths across the ocean to the heart that's coming home?

Long Long Journey

I don't know where

Long Long way to go

But what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home?

Long Long Journey

Through the darkness

Long Long way to go

But what are paths across the ocean to the heart that's coming home?

Long Long Journey

I don't know where

Long Long way to go

But what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home?

But what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home?
