Ladies leave your man at home

The club is full of ballers and there pockets full grown

And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends

Cuz its 11:30 and the club is jumpin jumpin

Though he say he got a girl

Yeah its true you got a man

But the party aint gon stop

So let's make it hot, hot

Last weekend you stayed at home alone and lonely

Couldn't find your man he was chillin with his homies

This weekend your goin out

If he try to stop you your goin off

You got your hair done and your nails done too

And your new outfit and your fendi shoes

And your Vous Parlez at the hottest spot tonite your gonna

Find the fellas rollin in the lexus, trucks, and hummers

Though he say he got a girl

Yeah its true you got a man

But the party aint gon stop

So let's make it hot, hot

Ladies leave your man at home

The club is full of ballers and there pockets full grown
