I'm ready

Ready for the laughing gas

I'm ready

Ready for what's next

Ready to duck

Ready to dive

Ready to say

I'm glad to be alive

I'm ready

I'm ready for the push

In the cool of the night

the wartmth of the breeze

I'll be crawling around

On my hands and knees

She's just down the line ... Zoo Station

Got to make it on time ... Zoo Station

I'm ready

I'm ready for the gridlock

I'm ready

To take it to the street

Ready for the shuffle

Ready for the deal

Ready to let go

Of the steering wheel

I'm ready

Ready for the crush

She's just down the line ... Zoo Station

Got to make it on time ... Zoo Station

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

]It's alright...it's alright...it's alright...it's alright

Hey baby...hey baby...hey baby...hey baby

it's alright

it's alright

Time is a train

Makes the future the past

Leaves you standing in the station

Your face pressed up against the glass

I'm just down the line from your love...Zoo Station

Under the sign of your love...Zoo Station

I'm gonna be there...Zoo Station

Tracing the line...Zoo Station

I'm gonna make it on time...make it on time...Zoo Station

Just two stops down the line...Zoo Station

Just a stops down the line...Zoo Station

Just a stops down the line...Zoo Station

Just two stops down the line...Zoo Station

Just a stops down the line...Zoo Station

Just a stops down the line...Zoo Station
