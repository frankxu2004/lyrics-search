Thank you, thank you, thank you 

You’re far too kind 

Haha 

Uh, yeah 

Ready? 

Let’s go 

Can I get a encore/do you want more 

Cookin’ raw with the Brooklyn boy 

So, for one last time, I need y’all to roar 

Now, what the hell are you waiting for 

After me, there shall be no more 

So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise 

Get ‘em, Jay 

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that 

The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at 

Can't none of y'all mirror me back 

Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime 

I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead 

Back to take over the globe, now break bread 

I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express 

out the country but the blueberry still connect 

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck 

But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep 

Grand openin, grand closing 

God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again 

Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen 

just draw off inspiration 

Soon you gon' see you can't replace him 

with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS 

Can I get a encore/do you want more 

Cookin’ raw with the Brooklyn boy 

So, for one last time, I need y’all to roar 

Now, what the hell are you waiting for 

So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise 

What the hell are you waiting for 

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you 

Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you 

When you first come in the game, they try to play you 

From Marcy to Madison Square 

Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you 

To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea) 

As fate would have it, Jay's status appears 

to be at an all-time high, 

perfect time to say goodbye 

When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5 

It ain't to play games witchu 

It's to aim at you, probably maim you 

If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens 

Cocksucker take one for your team 

And I need you to remember one thing (one thing) 

I came, I saw, I conquered 

From record sales, to sold out concerts 

So muh'fucker if you want this encore 

I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore 

I'm tired of being what you want me to be 

Feeling so faithless lost under the surface 

Don't know what you're expecting of me 

Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes 

(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 

Every step that I take is another mistake to you 

(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 

And every second I waste is more than I can take 

I've become so numb I can't feel you there 

I'

I'm becoming this all I want to do 

Is be more like me and be less like you 

I've become so numb 

Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...) 

I've become so numb 

So for one last time I need y'all to roar 

One last time I need y'all to roar 

One last time I need y'all to roar
