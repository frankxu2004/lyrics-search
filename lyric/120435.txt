Oh baby child

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky

It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight

They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon

You know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone that lets you help

It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else

They say a secret is something you tell one other person

So I'm telling you ... child

(Love, we shine like a)

(Burning star)

(We're falling from)

A man will beg (The sky)

A man will crawl

On the shear face of love (Tonight)

Like a fly on a wall

It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest

It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success

Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief

All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief

(Love, we shine like a)

(Burning star)

(We're falling from)

A man will rise (The sky)

A man will fall

From the shear face of love (Tonight)

Like a fly from a wall

It's no secret at all

(Love, we shine like a)

(Burning star)

(We're falling from)

(The sky)

(Tonight)

(Love, we shine like a)

(Burning star)

(We're falling from)

A man will rise (The sky)

A man will fall

From the shear face of love (Tonight)

Like a fly from a wall

It's no secret at all

Oh yeah

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky

The universe exploding 'cosa one man's lie

Look I gotta go

Yeah I'm running out of change

There's a lot of things

If I could I'd rearrange

If I could I'd rearrange
