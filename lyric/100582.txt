演唱：Mindless Self Indulgence

 ★ marissa 制作

Oohh, I'd rather fuck ya

than kiss ya

But I won't press the issue

You know what I need is

And ya never gonna be it

I shoulda hesitated

Limousine inebriated

So unsophisticated

Too late to be debated

It's 3 a.m. - she won't put out

Lets go make out with her friends

Make out with her friends' friends

It's 3 a.m. - she won't put out

Lets go make out with her friends

MAKE OUT WITH HER FRIENDS

Oohh, I want a lot of profanity

With a lot of lost virginity

It's a boy's intuition

With a right explanation

'Cause I'm on that mission

With deducted admission

Now take my clothes off

And show me what you're made of

It's 3 a.m. - she won't put out

Lets go make out with her friends

Make out with her friends' friends

It's 3 a.m. - she won't put out

MAKE OUT WITH HER FRIENDS

Excuse me, do you want to screw? [x2]

I'm so amazing in the sack

Yes, I'm so amazing in the sack

I'd rather fuck you than kiss you

I want a lot of profanity

With a lot of lost virginity

Now take those clothes off

And show me what you're made of

It's 3 a.m. - she won't put out

It's 3 a.m. - she won't put out

Lets go make out with her friends

Make out with her friends' friends

Make out with her friends,

make out with her friends' friends [x8]
