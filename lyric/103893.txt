Sweetbox-Cinderella

(Music)

Here I am, trying to find my way

I've kissed so many frogs but I never found a prince

I think they lied, I was promised much more than this

where's my happy ever after all

Cinderella is the queen of a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my happy end

Cinderella got a prince and a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my fairy-tale

Something's wrong 'cause all my glass shoes break

and no once ever helped this damsel in the stress

the hell it is, I'm not gonna waste more time

I won't wait and fight, prince show me

Cinderella is the queen of a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my happy end

Cinderella got a prince and a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my fairy-tale

Cinderella are you really that happy

Cinderella are you really that lucky

I wanna know is your life like you dream

Cinderella are you really that happy

Cinderella are you really that lucky

I wanna know is your life like you dream

Here I am, trying to find my way

I've kissed so many frogs but I never found a prince

I think they lied, I was promised much more than this

where's my happy ever after all

Cinderella is the queen of a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my happy end

Cinderella got a prince and a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my fairy-tale

Cinderella is the queen of a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my happy end

Cinderella got a prince and a kingdom

Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming

I wanna know where is my fairy-tale

(End)
