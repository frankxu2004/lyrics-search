CHEMISTRY - Here I am

作詞：CHEMISTRY/KB and Davix

作曲：KB and Davix

 ★ VAN制作

迷い道にいても

抜け出せばイイだけのハナシ

一億万通りのゴール

僕等のたどり着く先には

ほら　いつものハーモニー

重なり合うよ　my destiny

幕開けの時間さ　so here I am

派手にやらかすのさ　so here I am

今にもはじけそうさ　so here I am

On the stage we stand

and Lets throw up pur hands yeah

徒付く者も増え

好き勝手な言葉並べ

常に見比べられて

気づきゃどでかい壁に邪魔され

雨が続けば晴れる日もくる　destiny

踏み外しはしないさ　so here I am

負ける訳はないさ　so here I am

迷いなどもうないさ　so here I am

On the stage we stand

and Lets throw up pur hands yeah

今こうして　雲の合間から

星が見える

歌い　空へ手を伸ばし続けよう

Gonna get down for you

We're gonna break it down for you,

keep on keep on

break it down for you

We're gonna break it down for you,

keep on keep on

Gonna get down for you

We're gonna break it down for you,

keep on keep on

break it down for you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

幕開けの時間さ　so here I am

派手にやらかすのさ　so here I am

迷いなどもうないさ　so here I am

On the stage we stand

and Lets throw up pur hands yeah

It's time to get on with the how now,

so here I am

We're gonna make it feel the vibe,

so here I am

It's getting ready to explode now,

On the stage we stand

and lets throw up our hands yeah
