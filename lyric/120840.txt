The rain, just never seems to bring

the joy, I feel the same

everlasting pain of my loss remains

My heart, can't seem to learn to part

the hold you left the mark

all that I dreamed of now it seems so stark

Tho I told myself won't hold my breath

a part of me was dying

there is nothing left for me to do now, but give in

If you gave me, one more chance to tell you how i was feeling

I would sing to you and tell you I won't live my life without you

If you gave me, one more chance to tell you how i was feeling

I would hold your hand and look in your eyes and ya know,

I'd never let you go

The way, you left me on the train

I don't know what to say

I remember everything on that day

I can't believe we'd never dance

I just need one more chance

to share the sunset our one last romance

Tho I told myself won't hold my breath

a part of me was dying

there is nothing left for me to do now, but give in

If you gave me, one more chance to tell you how i was feeling

I would sing to you and tell you I won't live my life without you

If you gave me, one more chance to tell you how i was feeling

I would hold your hand and look in your eyes and ya know,

I'd never let you go

I'd never let you go

10. Never let you go (OT: 大哥)

If you gave me, one more chance to tell you how i was feeling

I would sing to you and tell you I won't live my life without you

If you gave me, one more chance to tell you how i was feeling

I would hold your hand and look in your eyes and ya know,

I'd never let you go

10. Never let you go (OT: 大哥)
