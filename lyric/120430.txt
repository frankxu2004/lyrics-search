Johnny take a walk

With your sister the moon

Let her pale light in

To fill up the room

You've been living underground

Eating from a can

You've been running away

From what you don't understand

Love

She's slippy

You're sliding down

She'll be there

If you hit the ground

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

She moves in mysterious ways

Johnny take a dive

With your sister in the rain

Let her talk about the things

You can't explain

To touch is to heal

To hurt is to steal

If you want to kiss the sky

Better learn how to kneel

On your knees boy

She's the wave

She turns the tide

She sees the man inside the child

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Lift my days ... light up my nights

One day you'll look back

And you'll see

Where you were held

How by this love

While

You could stand

There

You couldn't move on this moment

Follow this feeling

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

We move through miracle days

She moves with it

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Spirit moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

She moves with it

She moves with it

Lift my days ... light up my nights
