Do you lie awake in the morning

Trying to find a reason to call me

Cause honey all that Ive been doing

Is thinking about your smile

But none of this is necessary

with me baby

You see baby

Cause I like to keep it all simple

Cause you are my Satellite

So Im trying to keep you in sight

But with all this space

Can we keep it alive

Keep it alive

So Im asking you baby

Are you coming down tonight

Theres something in the air tonight

That feels right

But youre keeping me guessing and Im-

finding it hard to catch your eye

So move a little closer

Its alright

I know what youre thinking

Youve been circling me for a while

Youve been circling me for a while

Cause you are my Satellite

So Im trying to keep you in sight

But with all this space

Can we keep it alive

Keep it alive

So Im asking you baby

Are you coming down tonight

铜丸

Cause you are my Satellite

So Im trying to keep you in sight

But with all this space

Can we keep it alive

Keep it alive

So Im asking you baby

Are you coming down tonight

铜丸
