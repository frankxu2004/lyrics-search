Britney Spears - Breathe On Me

It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air.

Oh boy, don't stop 'cos I'm halfway there

It's not complicated, we're just syncopated

We can read each other's minds.

One love united

Two bodies synchronising

Don't even need to touch me

Baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh

Baby just, breathe on me

We don't need to touch, just

Breathe, oh, yeah

Oh, this is way beyond the physical (It's a way beyond the physical)

Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all

Our imagination, taking us to places

We have never been before

Take me in, let it out

Don't even need to touch me

Baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh baby

Just, breathe on me.

We don't need to touch, just

Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me), oh baby

Just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me)

We don't need to touch

Just breathe

Monogamy is the way to go

Just put your lips together and blow

Breathe, breathe, oh

Breathe on me (oh oh) oh

Baby just, breathe on me (on me)

We don't need to touch, just

Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me) oh

Baby just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me)

We don't need to touch, just

We don't need to touch, just
