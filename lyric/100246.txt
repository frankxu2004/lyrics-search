Take a look at the sky above

You will feel like you’re getting lost

A million stars turning ‘round and ‘round

You’ll see

If you look at the sky once more

You will feel like you’re not alone

An angel voice calling from the dark

You’ll hear

Listen to my silent song

Far from your world

A million light years

But I’ll love you forever

Listen to my silent song

Far from your world

A million light years

But I’ll love you forever

Instrumental

Take a look deep inside your soul

You will feel like there’s something wrong

An empty hole growing on and on

You’ll see

If you look at your soul once more

You will feel like you’re not alone

An angel voice deep inside your heart

You’ll hear

You’ll hear

Listen to my silent song

Far from your world

A million light years

But I’ll love you forever

Listen to my silent song

Far from your world

A million light years

But I’ll love you forever

Listen to my silent song

Far from your world

A million light years

But I’ll love you forever

Listen to my silent song

Far from your world

A million light years

But I’ll love you forever

Instrumental
