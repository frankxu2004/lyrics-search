I don't know how to love him

what to do, how to move him

I've been changed, yes really changed

in this past few days when I see myself

I seem like someone else

I don't know how to take this

I don't see why he moves me

he's a man, he's just a man

and I've had so many men before

in very many ways, he's just one more

should I bring him down

should I scream and shout

should I speak of love

let my feelings out

I'd never thought I'd come to this

what's it all about

so you think it's rather funny

I should be in his position

I'm the one, who's always there

so calm so cool, no lover's fool

running every show, he scares me so

---

I'd never thought I'd come to this

What's it all about

yet, if he said he loved me

I'd be lost, I'd be frightened

I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope

I'd turn my head, I'd back away

I wouldn't want to know

he scares me so

I wan't him so

I love him so

I love him so
