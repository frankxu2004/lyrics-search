Blue - ONLY WORDS I KNOW (Italian Version)

Dime de dónde vienes

What you say

Eres de aquí

I don't understand

Me gusta tu estilo

Sabes lo que te digo

What am I supposed to do,

just look at you

The situation like this

Ever since I saw you standing there

I couldn't get you outta my mind

So I thought I'd come and talk to you

But you couldn't understand my lines

Girl its like in our chemistry

There was something that gave me the sign

From the moment that I saw your spanish eyes

Couldn't figure out a word she was saying

But I could see you were looking amazing

Give me some help I need the translation

What does te quiero really mean? Tell me

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words I know

I wish that I could hold you and dame un beso

I wanna take you home

Cos I really really like you style

I can see you wanna get buck wild

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words

The only words I know

Chico bonito me atraes

Now the situation stresses me

cos I know what I've got in my hand

There's a millions things I wanna say

Like I really wanna be your man

Anticipation stresses me

coz I'm trying to get through to you

Body language is the only thing to use

Couldn't figure out a word she was saying

But I could see you were looking amazing

Give me some help I need the translation

What does te quiero really mean?

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words I know

I wish that I could hold you and dame un beso

I wanna take you home

Cos I really really like you style

I can see you wanna get buck wild

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words

The only words I know

Her body's calling

And I think I'm Falling

But I can't understand what she says

Chico bonito me atraes

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words I know

I wish that I could hold you and dame un beso

I wanna take you home

Cos I really really like you style

I can see you wanna get buck wild

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words

The only words I know

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words I know

I wish that I could hold you and dame un beso

I wanna take you home

Cos I really really like you style

I can see you wanna get buck wild

Senorita, chica bonita are the only words

The only words I know

END
