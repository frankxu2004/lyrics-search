U2 - City Of Blinding Lights

Album: How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb

The more you see the less you know

The less you find out as you grow

I knew much more then than I do now

Neon heart, day-glow eyes

The city lit by fireflies

They're advertising in the skies

And people like us

And I miss you when you're not around

I'm getting ready to leave the ground

Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh

Oh you look so beautiful tonight...

In the city of blinding lights

Don't think before you laugh

Look ugly in a photograph

Flash bulbs, purple irises the camera can't see

I've seen you walk unafraid

I've seen you in the clothes you've made

Can you see the beauty inside of me?

What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?

And I miss you when you're not around

I'm getting ready to leave the ground

Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh

Oh you look so beautiful tonight...

In the city of blinding lights

Time, time, time...

Won't leave me as I am

But time won't take the boy out of this man

Oh you look so beautiful tonight

Oh you look so beautiful tonight

Oh you look so beautiful tonight

In the city of blinding lights

The more you know the less you feel

Some pray for others steal

Blessings are not just for the ones who kneel… luckily

END
