Now Hush

My Little one

Don't be afraid, your daddy's right here

it's just a little dream

and now it's gone there's nothing to fear

so close your eyes, I'll sing a sweet lullaby

lay your head close to my heart

And sleep tight

may angels hover over you

they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and warm.

The starlight, the heavens high above you

will light a path at you to find your way back home

Yes sleep tight

And now, my sleepy head, your carriage weighs

to take you off to bed

Let go tiny hands and drift away to a bright enchanted land

I promise you, your sweetest dreams will come true

Now leave this weary world behind

And sleep tight

may angels hover over you

they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and warm.

The starlight, the heavens high above you

will light a path at you to find your way back home.

yeah sleep tight

so close your eyes and wish upon the brightest star

cause when you dream it doesn't matter where you are

near to me or very far

I'll always be with you

And sleep tight

they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and warm

The starlight, the heavens high above you

will light a path at you to find your way back home.

And sleep tight

may angels hover over you

they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and warm.

I'll keep you safe, safe and warm

I'll keep you safe and warm!

I'll keep you safe and warm!
