I never want to play the games that people play

I never want to hear the things they gotta say

I've found everything I need

I never wanted anymore than I can see

I only want you to believe

If it's wrong to tell the truth

Then what am I supposed to do

When all I want to do is speak my mind (speak my mind) - ALL

If it's wrong to do what's right

I'm prepared to testify

If loving you with all my heart's a crime - ALL

Then I'm guilty

I wanna give you all the things you never had

Don't try to tell me how he treats you isn't bad

I need you back in my life

I never wanted just to be the other guy (be the other guy - LEE)

I never wanted to live a lie

If it's wrong to tell the truth

What am I supposed to do

All I want to do is speak my mind (speak my mind) - ALL

If it's wrong to do what's right

I'm prepared to testify

If loving you with all my heart's a crime - ALL

Then I'm guilty

Girl I followed my heart

Followed the truth

Right from the start it led me to you

Please don't leave me this way

I'm guilty now all I have to say

If it's wrong to tell the truth

Then what am I supposed to do

When all I want to do is speak my mind (speak my mind) - ALL

If it's wrong to do what's right

I'm prepared to testify

If loving you with all my hearts a crime - ALL

Then I'm guilty

What am I supposed to do (Duncan)

Then I'm guilty (Lee)

All I wanna do is speak my mind (All)

Guilty (Lee)

Then I'm guilty (Lee)

I'm prepared to testify (Duncan)

If it's wrong to do what's right

then tell me about this feeling inside (Lee)

If loving you with all my hearts a crime (All)

I'm Guilty (Duncan)

END
