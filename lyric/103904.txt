Sweetbox-For The Lonely

(Music)

This is for the lonely

This is for the lonely

Sometimes I feel

I wished on the wrong star

Cuz I always seem so far

One that I dream of

Torn away from love

But I'll make it on my own

Cuz I'm learning to be strong

Memories of standing all alone

This is for the lonely

This is for the lonely

We all live underneath the same blue sky

This is for the lonely ones tonight

I'll help you find a way

To hold on

At night I pray

But no one's by my side

My tears they go unheard

I look for the words

To raise my heart

For now I'll say this prayer

That somehow, some day, somewhere

I will turn around and find love standing there

This is for the lonely

This is for the lonely

We all live underneath the same blue sky

This is for the lonely ones tonight

I'll help you find a way

To hold on

This is for the lonely

This is for the lonely

We all live underneath the same blue sky

All my tears they go unheard

Cuz no one's by my side

It's hard to be alone

It's hard to wait for love

Oh, yeah oh oh

Lonely, hey yeah yeah

This is for the lonely ones tonight

I'll help you find a way

To hold on

This is for the lonely

This is for the lonely

We all live underneath the same blue sky

This is for the lonely ones tonight

I'll help you find a way

(End)

(End)
