I’m just the same as you

I could be the same age too

Do the same music you do

Everyday

No matter what separates us

The same stars we see at night

No matter what’s up against us

Still gonna have dream burning right

I believe we fear what we don't know,

we can be our own enemy

But if we concord and

If you took my hand

I see a girl you see a man

Everybody has the same dream

A dream in their heart

Get a chance to make a life

Love somebody they want

Open your eyes we’re all the same

We won’t be scared

So let’s sing together now

Na na na na

In this Universal Prayer

Oh oh … na na na na

I see the smoking light

That complicates a simple life

I’m here and you are there

Miles away

All you gotta do is believe

That anything you want you can reach

There’s no limit to what we could be

So open your mind

And set yourself free

I believe we fear what we don't know,

we can be our own enemy

But if we concord and

If you took my hand

I see a girl you see a man

Everybody has the same dream

A dream in their heart

Get a chance to make a life

Love somebody they want

Open your eyes we’re all the same

We won’t be scared

So let’s sing together now

Na na na na

In this Universal Prayer

And in this dream I have at night

That I don’t understand the world at all

You might be right but it seems to me

That we’ve come to fight too far

Cause I believe that fears

I try to save our souls

And hardest time will come

And all this pain will go

So try to understand

The precious things I’ve said

Every woman every man

Oh oh … na na na na

Everybody has the same dream

A dream in their heart

Get a chance to make a life

Love somebody they want

Open your eyes we’re all the same

We won’t be scared

So let’s sing together now

Na na na na

In this Universal Prayer

Everybody has the same dream

A dream in their heart

Get a chance to make a life

Love somebody they want

Open your eyes we’re all the same

We won’t be scared

So let’s sing together now

Na na na na

In this Universal Prayer

Oh oh … na na na na
