So I know that, when it's time to sink or swim

You're wasting your talent, randy

I got no patience

In the cut where I keep 'em

A face that laughs every time I fall

Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion

It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

It's like a whirlwind inside of my head

Let em play with the dick in the truck

It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

We doin.. big pimpin, we spendin G's

And I hate waitin..

So you can be livin it up? Shit I..

Or how the pressure was fed

RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah

Til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts

We doin - big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s

We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.

To have a voice in the back of my head

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back

And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now

It's like a whirlwind inside of my head

Me give my heart to a woman?

We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.

Check em out now

Hoe get yo' ass in

Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up

Paranoia's all I got left

Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread

I'll be forever mackin

Cause I dont fucking need em

Why am I so uptight today?

Take 'em out the 'hood, keep 'em lookin good

But, I know just what it feels like

-= Linkin Park & Jay-Z - Big Pimpin' & Papercut =-

Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs

"What's the reason?"

I'm a pimp in every sense of the word bitch

But I dont fucking feed 'em

RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah

A face that awakes when I close my eyes

Something in here's not right today

It's like the face inside is right...

Right underneath my skin

Big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s

And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now

(And watches everything)

I don't know what stressed me first

It's like the face inside is right

Better trust and believe him

Why does it look like night today?

That the face inside is hearing me

Hahaha

You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em

It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back

A face that watches every time I lie

It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

Yo yo yo.. big pimpin, spendin G's

First time they fuss I'm breezing, talking about:

It's like a face that I hold inside

Not for nothin, never happen

Parts with nothin, y'all be frontin

Divorce him and split his bucks
