Kaitlyn - Friend

I like to be around you

when your not tryin to be somebody

and I like to hang with you

talk about whatever we talk about

I don't care where we go

what we do

who you know

what you wear

or if your hair is blue or purple or pink

you don't have to be cool

don't have to be smart

don't need to know anything all the time

its alright if your a little bit out of it

I don't care I just wanna be your friend

(just wanna be your friend)

I like to go to the mall

and walk around with you laughin out loud

and you like to go up to people

and tell them your cousin is somebody famous

don't care who we see

what they say

you and me we'll be ok

if we don't get caught by security

you don't have to be cool

don't have to be smart

don't need to know every thing all the time

its alright if your a little bit out of it

I don't care I just wanna be your friend

I tell you what I don't tell any one else

just having you here you no where

helps me

you don't have to be cool

don't have to be smart

don't have to know anything all the time

don't have to be tough

don't have to be cute

don't neeed to know anything any time

its alright if your a little bit out of it

I don't care I just wanna be I just wanna be your friend

don't have to be cool

don't have to be smart

don't have to be tough

don't have to be cute

don't need to know every thing all the time

anything any time

I just wanna be your frined

I just wanna be your friend

I like to be around you when your not tryin to be somebody
