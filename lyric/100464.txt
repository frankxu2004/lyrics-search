From the moment I met you

I just knew you'd be mine

You touched my hand

And I knew that this was gonna be our time

I don't ever wanna lose this feeling

I don't wanna spend a moment apart

'Cause you bring out the best in me

Like no-one else can do

That's why I'm by your side

And that's why I love you

Every day that I'm here with you

I know that it feels right

And I've just got to be near you

Every day and every night

And you know that we belong together

It just had to be you and me

'Cause you bring out the best in me

Like no-one else can do

That's why I'm by your side

And that's why I love you

And you know that we belong together

It just had to be you and me

'Cause you bring out the best in me

Like no-one else can do

That's why I'm by your side

'Cause you bring out the best in me

Like no-one else can do

That's why I'm by your side,

And that's why I love you

'Cause you bring out the best in me

Like no-one else can do

That's why I'm by your side

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you
