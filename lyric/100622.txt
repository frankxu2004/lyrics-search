God Rest You Merry Gentlemen

God rest you merry, gentlemen,

Let nothing you dismay,

Remember Christ our Savior

Was born on Christmas Day;

To save us all from Satan's power

When we were gone astray.

O tidings of comfort and joy,

Comfort and joy,

O tidings of comfort and joy!

From God our heavenly Father

A blessed angel came;

And unto certain shepherds

Brought tiding of the same;

How that in Bethlehem was born

The Son of God by name.

O tidings of comfort and joy,

Comfort and joy,

O tidings of comfort and joy!

"Fear not, then," said the angel,

"Let nothing you affright;

This day is born a Savior

Of a pure virgin bright,

To free all those who trust in him

From Satan's power and might."

O tidings of comfort and joy,

Comfort and joy,

O tidings of comfort and joy!

Now to the Lord sing praises,

All you within this place,

And with true love and brotherhood

Each other now embrace;

this holy tide of Christmas

Doth bring redeeming grace.

O tidings of comfort and joy,

Comfort and joy,

O tidings of comfort and joy!

O tidings of comfort and joy!
