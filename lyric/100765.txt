Jonas Brothers - One Day At A Time

 ★ 沉醉寒风 制作

Wednesday I came home from school

Did my homework in my room

then I watched some TV

I still miss you

Thursday morning went online

Got to school at half past nine

Wound up in detention

I still miss you

Everything I do (oh)

brings me back to you

And I die

One day at a time

Cause I just cant seem to get you off my mind

No matter how I try

try to kill the time

well I think that im just going crazy

one day at a time

Friday I got out of bed

Tried to smile frowned instead

Burnt some toast for breakfast

I still miss you

Saturday I turned 16

Never dreamt you’d act so mean

You didn’t even call me

But I still miss you

And When I turn 94

I think ill miss u even more

And I die

One day at a time

’Cause I just can’t seem to get you off my mind

No matter how I try

try to kill the time

well I think that im just going crazy

one day at a time

I miss you more than I did a min ago

I Climb a mountain just to here your echo (hoo, hoo)

All I wanted was you

Tell me please do u think of me now and then

Cause if I never see you again

I still miss you

And I die

One day at a time

Cause I just can’t seem to get you off my mind

No matter how I try

try to kill the time

well I think that im just going craaazy

one day at a time

(Oooo) one day at a time

Well I think that im just going crazy one day at a time

Oo I think im going crazy ooooooo

One day at a time
