ooh ooh oooh

hold up, stop now, let me get a look you

damn girl i aint see u since prom

come to think bout it cant belive it been that long

girl i heard your man locked down now

how long he gone? oh, that long

how the hell he get time like that

3 strikes for possesion ahh he aint coming back

he left you with two kids and bills all around

plus you found out he had another chick across town

its always the darkest right before the sun rise

and you gotta stay strong for the kids in there eyes'n

and please dont despise and go against all brothers

and have a hatred in heart and take it out on another

i hate to sound 2pac-ish lil mama but keep your head up

but your gonna make it i promise you keep your head up

and that, that dont kill you only makes you stronger

and the will to succeed only feed the hunger

for real, for real, for real, (ha-haha-ha-ha)

hey ooh

n dey say ooh oooh ooh

(ha-haha-ha-ha)

n dey say ooh oooh ooh

i was at the gas station when a man walked passed

with a sign will work for food, clothes or cash

and he asked if he could pump my gas so i let him

clean the windsheild and throw out the trash so i let him

hey, i even asked the brother his name

where he was from, got kids man and whats they ages

he kinda stared for a second he kinda looked suprised

that anyone would even take an intrest in his life

he said young brother there the only words ive heard in the last year

was a no and get the fuck away from hurr

how could something so simple as general conversation

mean much more than general conversation

hey you could tell life had beaten him down

like he was in the title fight and this might be his last round

sometimes the easiest things we take for granted

until there gone we realized we even had it

for real, for real, for real (ha-haha-ha-ha)

hey ooh

n dey say ooh oooh ooh

(ha-haha-ha-ha)

n dey say ooh oooh ooh

i used to think that life had a plan for me

until i realized life had to be planned by me

see thats the key i only deal wit what i can see

cuz over history, mystery brought us nothin but misery

theres more people that done died in the name of the lord

then in any natural disaster, disease or gang wars

before guns there was swords and they was killing each other

aint much changed to this day we still killing each other

killing our brothers while another mother cries for help

man we need to help a brother find himself

feed 'em life 1, 2, 3

hey theres something every brother should see

and thats for real,

and thats for real,

and thats for real

hey ooh ooh ohh

n dey say ooh ooh ohh

(ha-haha-ha-ha)

hey ooh ooh ohh

n dey say ooh ooh ohh

(ha-haha-ha-ha)

(ha-haha-ha-ha)
