Lies on my breath

I am drowning in my dread

The wind is getting strong

The wind is getting stronger

There’s no second chance

Once the devils made you dance

The sky is getting dark

The sky is getting dark

Can’t you see

Can’t you see

We were never meant to be

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl

Don’t you know

Don’t you know

That it’s time for me to go

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl

No turning back

No questions left to ask

The tide is getting high

The tide is getting higher

I’m not afraid

I decided on this fate

It’s time to face the storm

It’s time to face the storm

Can’t you see

Can’t you see

We were never meant to be

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl

Don’t you know

Don’t you know

That it’s time for me to go

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl

You live you learn

And right now my scarlet letter burns

But I won’t hide

I’ll face what’s mine

I’ll face what’s mine

Lies on my breath

I am drowning in my dread

The wind is getting strong

The wind is getting stronger

There’s no second chance

Once the devils made you dance

The sky is getting dark

The sky is getting dark

Can’t you see

Can’t you see

We were never meant to be

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl

Don’t you know

Don’t you know

That it’s time for me to go

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl

Can’t you see

Can’t you see

We were never meant to be

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl

Don’t you know

Don’t you know

That it’s time for me to go

It’s no secret

That I’m your Chyna girl
