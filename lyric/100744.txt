Gimme a reason

Why Im feeling so blue

Everytime I close my eyes, all I see is you

Gimme a reason

Why I cant feel my heart

Everytime you leave my side, I just fall apart

And when youre fast asleep, I wonder where you go

Can you tell me, I wanna know

Because I miss you

And this is all I wanna say

I guess I miss you, beautiful

These three words have said it all

You know I miss you

I think about you when youre gone

I guess I miss you, nothings wrong

I dont need to carry on

Gimme a reason

Why I cant concentrate

The world is turning upside down

Spinning round and round

Gimme a reason

Why I now understand

The beauty and simplicity of everything surrounding me

You got a way of spreading magic everywhere

Anywhere I go, I know youre always there

It sounds ridiculous, but when you leave a room

Theres a part of me that just wants to follow you too

Because I miss you

And this is all I wanna say

I guess I miss you, beautiful

These three words have said it all

You know I miss you

I think about you when youre gone

I guess I miss you, nothings wrong

I dont need to carry on

Its such a hard life in most of the time 

Im just surviving

Thats why I want you to know

In the world where sincerity has lost its meaning

You fill my world with so much hope

And I miss you

This is all I wanna say

I guess I miss you, beautiful

These three words have said it all

You know I miss you

I think about you when youre gone

I guess I miss you, nothings wrong

I dont need to carry on

You know I miss you

And this all I wanna say

I guess I miss you, beautiful

These three words have said it all

You know I miss you

And this is all I wanna do

I know it doesnt sound too cool

But maybe Im in love with you

You know I miss you

And this all I wanna say

I guess I miss you, nothings wrong

I dont need to carry on

I just miss you

Yeah, its true

I miss you, baby

And when youre walking out that door

I know I miss you

You make me wanna ask for more

I just miss you

Yeah, its true

I miss you, baby
