Westlife - Colour My World

Everybody needs affection

Looking for a deep connection

So put a little bit of love in my life today

Everybody needs some shelter

Spend a little time together

Come into my arms

Let them tell you what I want to say

Color my world

Draw on my heart

Take a picture of what you think love

looks like in your imagination

Write on my soul

Everything you know

Use every word you've ever heard

To color my world

I've had enough of not believing

Living life without a meaning

I want something real

and I feel it when I'm next to you

Let's put out some love and devotion

Window to my heart's emotion

'Til the very end

It's the place I'm gonna keep you in,

yeah yeah yeah yeah

Color my world

Draw on my heart

Take a picture of what you think love

looks like in your imagination

Write on my soul

Everything you know

Use every word you've ever heard

To color my world

Let's make a world for you and me

That were never gonna leave

Won't you do it

Won't you color my world

Color my world

Draw on my heart

Take a picture of what you think love

looks like in your imagination

Write on my soul (write on my soul)

Everything you know

Use every word you've ever heard

To color my world

Take a picture of what you think love

looks like in your imagination

Use every word you've ever heard

To color my world

Everybody needs affection

Looking for a deep connection

Oh, color my world
