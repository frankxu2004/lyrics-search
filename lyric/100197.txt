I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see,

But I can’t pretend this is the way it’ll stay,

All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin',

Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche,

When I pretend everything is what I want it to be,

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,

(No turning back now),

Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced,

Would have you running from me,

This isn’t what I wanted to be,

Alright, let's do this.

And I’m trying to bend the truth,

All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin',

(No, no turning back now),

So I’m lying my way from..

Is me.

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off,

If you feelin' like a pimp *****, go and brush your shoulders off,

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder.

Like this (like this),

The very worst part of you,

Would have you runnin’ from me,

Lemme take back my life,

***** London, Japan and I'm straight off the block,

I never thought that what I said,

(No, no turning back now),

I never thought that what I said,

This isn’t what I wanted to be,

I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean,

Lemme take back my life,

Remember condescending talk of who I outta be,

(No turning back now),

But, the more I push, the more I’m pullin’ away,

‘Cause I can see,

Like this,

And now you think this person really is me,

Anywhere on my own,

So let me go,

So let me go,

Now, fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em,

I’d rather be all alone,

Biatch!

Would have you running from me,

I never thought that what I said,

I’m just trying to bend the truth,

I wanna be pushed aside,

Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block,

Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling,

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,

Yeah, I remember what they taught to me,

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force,

But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin,

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda

Is me.

With a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve,

I ordered a frappachino.

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off,

(No turning back now),

This isn’t what I wanted to be,

At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen,

I never thought that what I said,

I can’t pretend I’m who you want me to be,

Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you,

Like this (like this),

Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir,

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,

‘Cause I’m lying my way from you.

But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it,

This isn’t what I wanted to be,

The very worst part of you,

(No, no turning back now),

If you feelin' like a pimp *****, go and brush your shoulders off,

I wanna be pushed aside,

Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops,

No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real.

When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am,

‘Cause I can see,

Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you,

So I pretended up a person who was fittin’ in,

Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

Remember listenin’ to all of that and this again,

Like this.

I’d rather be all alone,

The very worst part of you,

I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover

Anywhere on my own,

You..

In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin',

All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin',

Where's my fucking frappachino?

I can run it back, *****, cause I'm straight with the Roc.

Stealin’ second after second just ‘cause I know I can,

Get, that, dirt off your shoulder.

Would have you running from me,

(No, no turning back now),

Middle finger to the law, *****, grippin' my balls,

Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya,

The very worst part of you,
