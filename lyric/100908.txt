Tatu - 30 Minutes

Mama, Papa forgive me

Out of sight, out of mind

Out of time to decide

Do we run? Should I hide?

For the rest of my life

Can we fly? Do we stay?

We could lose, we could fail

In the moment it takes

To make plans or mistakes

30 minutes, the blink of an eye

30 minutes to alter our lives

30 minutes to make up my mind

30 minutes to finally decide

30 minutes to whisper your name

30 minutes to shoulder the blame

30 minutes of bliss, 30 lies

30 minutes to finally decide

Carousels in the sky

That we shape with our ways

Under shade silhouettes

Casting shame

Crying rain

Can we fly? do I stay?

We could lose, we could fail

Either way, options change

Chances fade, Trains derail.

30 minutes, the blink of the night

30 minutes to alter our lives

30 minutes to make up my mind

30 minutes to finally decide

30 minutes to whisper your name

30 minutes to shoulder the blame

30 minutes of bliss, 30 lies

30 minutes to finally decide

To decide, to decide to decide to decide

To decide to decide to decide to decide

To decide

END

END
