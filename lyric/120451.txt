U2 - Love And Peace Or Else

Album: How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb

Lay down

Lay down

Lay your sweet lovely on the ground

Lay your love on the track

We're gonna break the monster's back

Ah...

Lay down your treasure

Lay it down now brother

You don't have time

For a jealous lover

As you enter this life

I pray you depart

With a wrinkled face

And a brand new heart

I don't know if I can take it

I'm not easy on my knees

Here's my heart you can break it

I need some release, release, release

We need

Love and peace

Love, love and peace

Lay down

Lay down your guns

All your daughters of Zion

All your Abraham sons

I don't know if I can make it

I'm not easy on my knees

Here's my heart and you can break it

I need some release, release, release

We need

Love and peace

Love and peace

Baby don't fight

We can talk this thing through

It's just me and you

I'll call or you phone

The TV is still on

But the sound is turned down

And the troops on the ground

Are about to dig in

And I wonder where is the love?

Where is the love?

Love and peace

Where is the love?

Where is the love?

Where is the love?

END

END
