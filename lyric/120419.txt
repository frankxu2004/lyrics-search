Madonna - Sorry

制作

Je suis desolé

Lo siento

Ik ben droevig

Sono spiacente?

Perdóname!

I've heard it all before...

I don't wanna hear

I don't wanna know

Please don't say you're sorry

I've heard it all before

And I can take care of myself

I don't wanna hear

I don't wanna know

Please don't say forgive me

I've seen it all before

And I can't take it anymore

You're not half a man you think you are

Save your words because you've gone too far

Listen to your lies and to your stories

You're not half a man you like to be

I don't wanna hear

I don't wanna know

Please don't say you're sorry

I've heard it all before

And I can take care of myself

I don't wanna hear

I don't wanna know

Please don't say forgive me

I've seen it all before

And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap

There's more important things than hear you speak

You stay because I made it so convenient

Don't explain yourself you'll never see

Sorry sorry sorry sorry...

I've heard it all before...

I don't wanna hear

I don't wanna know

Please don't say you're sorry

I've heard it all before

And I can take care of myself

I don't wanna hear

I don't wanna know

Please don't say forgive me

I've seen it all before

And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap

There's more important than hear you speak

I've heard it all before...

I've heard it all before...
