Here With Me

Dido

I didn't here you leave

I wonder how am I still here

I don't want to move a thing

It might change my memory

Oh I am what I am

I'll do what I want

but I can't hide

I won't go

I won't sleep

I can't breathe

until you're resting here with me

I won't leave

I can't hide

I cannot be

until your resting here with me

I don't want to call my friends

they might wake me from this dream

and I can't leave this bed

risk forgetting all that's been

Oh I am what I am

I'll do what I want

but I can't hide

I won't go

I won't sleep

I can't breathe

until you're resting here with me

I won't leave

I can't hide

I cannot be

until your resting here with me

I won't go

I won't sleep

I can't breathe

until you're resting here with me

I won't leave

I can't hide

I cannot be

until your resting here with me

Oh I am what I am

I'll do what I want

but I can't hide

I won't go

I won't sleep

I can't breathe

until you're resting here with me

I won't leave

I can't hide

I cannot be

until your resting here with me

I won't go

I won't sleep

I can't breathe

until you're resting here with me

I won't leave

I can't hide

I cannot be

until your resting here with me

THE END

THE END
