You're like a storm against the window

Follow me around just like a shadow

I’ll swim a never ending ocean

Until you bring back your devotion

It’s like I live a thousand lifetimes

Still looking for the one that feels right

See, moving on just isn’t working

You lit the fire that I burn in

And all I've been doing is protecting

A lie for the sake of my pride

While all the others had me thinking

We could be more than just amazing

I guess I’m holding on to my faith

A solid hope I’m heading your way

And crawling over is so tempting

We could be more than just amazing

And all I've been doing is protecting

A lie for the sake of my pride

While all the others had me thinking

We could be more than just amazing

I couldn’t see it

I must have believed a lie

If I admit it would you let me make it right?

Is it all gone?

(Oh no)

We could be more than just

we could be more than just amazing

And all I've been doing is protecting

A lie for the sake of my pride

And all the others had me thinking

We could be more than just amazing

And all I've been doing is protecting

A lie for the sake of my pride

While all the others had me thinking

straight to the point of what I’m feeling

oh we could be more than just amazing

Amazing

Westlife
