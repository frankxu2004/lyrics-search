High, higher than the sun

You shoot me from a gun

I need you to elevate me here

At corner of your lips

As the orbit of your hips

Eclipse

You elevate my soul

I’ve got no self control

Been living like a mole now

Going down, excavation

I and I in the sky

You make me feel like I can fly

So high

Elevation

A star

Lit up like a cigar

Strung out like a guitar

Maybe you can educate my mind

Explain all these controls

Can’t sing but I’ve got soul

The goal is elevation

A mole

Digging in a hole

Digging up my soul now

Going down, excavation

I and I in the sky

You make me feel like I can fly

So high

Elevation

Love

Lift me up out of these blues

Won’t you tell me something true

I believe in you

A mole

Digging in a hole

Digging up my soul now

Going down, excavation

Higher now

In the sky

You make me feel like I can fly

So high

Elevation

Elevation

Elevation

Elevation

Elevation
