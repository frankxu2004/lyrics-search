You push me to go the extra mile

You push me when it's difficult to smile

You push me, a better version of myself

You push me, only you and no one else

You push me to see the other point of view

You push me when there's nothing else to do

You push me when I think I know it all

You push me when I stumble and I fall

Keep on pushin'

like nobody

Every place I live, every mood I'm in

Everything I do, I owe it all to you

Every move I make, every step I take

Every thing I know, it's all because you push me

You push me when I don't appreciate

You push me not to lie and not to hate

You push me when I want it all to end

You push me when I really need a friend

You push me, all I wanna do is cry

You push me when it's time for me to try

You push me when I do it for myself

You push me, only you and no one else

Keep on pushin' like nobody

Every place I live, every mood I'm in

Everything I do, I owe it all to you

Every move I make, every step I take

Every thing I do, it's all because you push me

You push me

Keep on pushin' like nobody

Keep on, keep on

Every place I live

Every mood I'm in

Everything I do

I owe it all to you

Every move I make

Every step I take

Every thing I do

It's all because you push me

Every place I live

Every mood I'm in

Everything I do

I owe it all to you

Every move I make

Every step I take

Every thing I do

It's all because you push me

You push me

You push me
