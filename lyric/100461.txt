Blue - One Love

It's kinda funny 

How life can change 

Can flip 180 in a matter of days 

Sometimes love works in 

Mysterious ways 

One day U wake up 

Gone without a trace 

I refuse to give up 

I refuse to give in 

You're my everythin' 

I don't wanna give up 

I don't wanna give in 

So everybody sing 

One love for the mother's pride 

One love for the times we cried 

One love gotta stay alive...I will survive 

One love for the city streets 

One love for the hip hop beats 

One love oh I do believe 

One love is all we need 

Late at night I'm still wide awake 

Feelin' this is one more than I can take  

I thought my heart could 

Never break 

Now I know that's one big mistake  

I refuse to give up 

I refuse to give in 

You're my everythin' 

I don't wanna give up 

I don't wanna give in 

Everybody sing

One love for the mother's pride 

One love for the times we cried 

One love gotta stay alive...I will survive 

One love for the city streets 

One love for the hip hop beats 

One love oh I do believe 

One love is all we need 

Baby just love me love me love me 

Baby just hold me hold me hold me 

Ooooh love me love me love me 

Oh yeah..one love 

Baby just love me love me love me

Baby just hold me hold me hold me 

Ooooh love me love me love me 

One love for the mother's pride 

One love for the times we cried 

One love gotta stay alive...I will survive 

One love for the city streets 

One love for the hip hop beats 

On

One love is all we need 

One love for the mother's pride 

One love for the times we cried 

One love gotta stay alive...I will survive 

One love for the city streets 

One love for the hip hop beats 

One love oh I do believe 

One love is all we need
