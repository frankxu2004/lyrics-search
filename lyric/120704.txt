Eminem - Just Lose It

Guess who's back

Back again

Shady's back

Tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor

To the dance floor, to the dance floor

Now everyone report to the dance floor

All right stop! Pajama time

Come here little kiddies on my lap

Guess who's back with a brand new rap

And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child investigate

And accusate (ahh ahh ahh!)

No words, papas got a brand new bag of toys

What else could I possibly do to make noise

I done touched on everything but little boys

Thats not a stab a Michael, thats just a metaphor

I'm just psycho, I go a little bit crazy sometimes

I get a little bit outta control with my rhymes

Good god chick do a little slide

Bend now touch your toes and just glide

Up the center of the dance floor like TP for my bunghole

And its cool if you let one go

No body's gonna know who hear it

Give a little toot toot its okay

Oops my cd just skipped

And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance get your chance

Yeah boy shake that ass oops I meant girl

Girl, girl, girl, girl you know you're my world

Aight now lose it ahh ahh ahh, just lose it ahh ahh ahh

Go crazy ahh ahh ahh oh baby oh baby

Now its friday and its my day

To party all the way to sunday

Every single monday I dont know what day

Everyday's just a holiday

Cruisin on the freeway, feelin kinda breezy

Get the top down, let my hair blow

I don't know where I'm goin

But when I get there I know someone's gonna touch my body

Excuse me miss I don't mean to sound like a jerk

But I'm feelin a lil stressed out from work

Could you punch me in the stomache and pull my hair

Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out yeah

Whats your name girl whats your scurr?

[Now you must be up out your mind]

Dre ahh ahh beer guy goes blind

I'm just tryna unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance get your chance

Yeah boy shake that ass oops I meant girl

Girl, girl, girl, girl you know you're my world

Aight now lose it ahh ahh ahh, just lose it ahh ahh ahh

Go crazy ahh ahh ahh oh baby oh baby

Now its tuesday and I'm locked up

I'm in jail and I don't know what happened

Each day I was runnin butt naked

down the street screamin ahh ahh ahh

Mother I'm sorry I don't need your number

All I need is this much I'm not guilty

They said save it or we'll get you on tape

tellin an old lady touch my body

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down

Its real intense no one makes a sound

Everything looks like its 8 Mile now

The beat comes back everybody just lose theirselves

Snap back to reality look its B Rabbit

Yo you signed me up to battle?

I'm a grown man jubba jubba jubba jubba jubba jubba

I know dont have any life I took a right hand whole

Tell me fellas what tell me fellas what grab ya left nut

and make ya right one jealous

Black girls, white girls, skinny girls,

fat girls, tall girls, small girls

I'm callin all girls everyone report to the dance floor

Its just chance for a little romance whore

Butt squeezin its the season just go ahh ahh ahh

So upeasin

Now I'm gonna make you dance get your chance

Yeah boy shake that ass oops I meant girl

Girl, girl, girl, girl you know you're my world

Aight now lose it ahh ahh ahh, just lose it ahh ahh ahh

Go crazy ahh ahh ahh oh baby oh baby

Touch my body, touch my body

Ooh boy just touch my body

I mean girl just touch my body
