I'm standing on the bridge

I'm waiting in the dark

I thought that you'd be here by now

There's nothing but the rain

No footsteps on the ground

I'm listening but there's no sound

Isn't anyone trying to find me

Won't somebody come take me home

It's a damn cold night

Trying figure out this life

Won't you take me by the hand take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are but I I'm with you

I'm with you

I'm looking for a place

I'm searching for a face

Is anybody here I know

Cos nothing's going right and

Everythings a mess

And no-one like's to be alone

Isn't anyone trying to find me

Won't somebody take me home

It's a damn cold night

Trying to figure out this life

Won't you take me by the hand take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are but I I'm with you

I'm with you

Oh why is everything so confusing

Maybe i'm just out of my mind

Yeah Yeah

Yeah Yeah

Yeah Yeah

Yeah

It's a damn cold night

Trying to figure out this life

Won't you take me by the hand take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are but I I'm with you

I'm with you

Take me by the hand take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are but I I'm with you

I'm with you

Take me by the hand take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are but I I'm with you

I'm with you

I'm with you
