Superwoman

LRC by:Jack QQ:125287385

early in the morning, i put breakfast at your table

and i make sure that your coffee has it's suger and cream

your eggs are over easy, you toast like it 

all that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me 

now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet

and i can't help but to wonder if you're talking about me 

we don't talk the way we used to talk, it's hurting so deep 

i've got my pride, i will not cry 

but it's making me weak (i'm not your superwoman)

i'm not the kind of girl that you can let down 

and think that eveything's ok. boy, i am only human 

this girl needs more than occasional

heart as a token of love from you to me

ooh~ baby
