Oooh-oooh

Everybody's got something

They had to leave behind

One regret from yesterday

That just seems to grow with time

There's no use looking back or wondering

(Or wondering)

How it could be now or might have been

(Or might have been)

All this I know but still I can't find ways

To let you go

I never had a dream come true

'Til the day that I found you

Even though I pretend that I've moved on

You'll always be my baby

I never found the words to say

You're the one I think about each day

And I know no matter where life takes me to

A part of me will always be with you, yeah

Somewhere in my memory

I've lost all sense of time (ah-ha, ha-ha)

And tommorow can never be

'Cos yesterday is all that fills my mind

There's no use looking back or wondering

(Wondering)

How it should be now or might have been

(Or might have been)

All this I know but still I can't find ways

To let you go

I never had a dream come true

'Til the day that I found you

Even though I pretend that I've moved on

You'll always be my baby

I never found the words to say

You're the one I think about each day

And I know no matter where life takes me to

A part of me will always be

You'll always be the dream that fills my head

Yes you will, say you will

You know you will, oh baby

You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget

It's no use looking back or wondering

(Or wondering)

Because love is a strange and funny thing

(And funny thing)

No matter how I try and try

I just can't say goodbye, no, no, no, no

I never had a dream come true

'Til the day that I found you

Even though I pretend that I've moved on

You'll always be my baby

I never found the words

(Never found the words to say) to say

You're the one I think about each day (each day)

And I know no matter where life takes me to

A part of me will always be

A part of me will always be with you, ooh

A part of me will always be with you, ooh
