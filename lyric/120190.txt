I wanna call the stars

Down from the sky

I wanna live a day

That never dies

I wanna change the world

Only for you

All the impossible

I wanna do

I wanna hold you close

Under the rain

I wanna kiss your smile

And feel the pain

I know what's beautiful

Looking at you

In a world of lies

You are the truth

And baby

Everytime you touch me

I become a hero

I'll make you safe

No matter where you are

And bring you

Everything you ask for

Nothing is above me

I'm shining like a candle in the dark

When you tell me that you love me

I wanna make you see

Just what I was

Show you the loneliness

And what it does

You walked into my life

To stop my tears

Everything's easy now

I have you here

And baby

Everytime you touch me

I become a hero

I'll make you safe

No matter where you are

And bring you

Everything you ask for

Nothing is above me

I'm shining like a candle in the dark

When you tell me that you love me

Ooooooh

In a world without you (Mark: world without you)

I would always hunger (Mark: I will always hunger)

All I need is your love

...to make me stronger

Everytime you touch me

I become a hero

I'll make you safe

No matter where you are (Mark: Matter where you are)

And bring you

Everything you ask for

Nothing is above me

I'm shining like a candle in the dark

When you tell me that you love me

When you tell me that you love me

You love me

When you tell me that you love me
