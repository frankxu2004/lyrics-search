Madonna - How High

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

It's funny, I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about

I did it, just about everything to see my name in lights

Was it all worth it? And how did I earn it?

Nobody's perfect, I guess I deserve it

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

Does this get any better?

Should I carry on?

Will it matter when I'm gone?

Will any of this matter?

It's funny how everybody mentions my name,

they're never very nice

I took it, just about everything except my own advice

Was it all worth it? And how did I earn it?

Nobody's perfect, I guess I deserve it

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

Does this get any better?

Should I carry on?

Will it matter when I'm gone?

Will any of this matter?

How high, does it make a difference?

Nothing lasts forever

Should I, will it matter when I'm gone?

Will any of this matter?

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

Should I carry on?

Will it matter when I'm gone?

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

Does this get any better?

Should I carry on?

Will it matter when I'm gone?

Will any of this matter?

How high are the stakes?

(How high, does it make a difference?)

Nothing lasts forever

Does this get any better?

Should I carry on?

(Should I, will it matter when I’m gone?)

Does it make a difference?

Will any of this matter?

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

Should I carry on?

Will it matter when I’m gone?

How high are the stakes?

How much fortune can you make?

Should I carry on?

Will it matter when I’m gone?
