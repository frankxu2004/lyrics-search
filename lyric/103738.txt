Hilary Duff - Our Lips Are Sealed

Album: Most Wanted

Editor: FlwoerSpider

Can you hear them

They talk about us

Telling lies

Well that's no surprise

Can you see them

See right through them

They have no shield

No secrets to reveal

It doesn't matter what they say

In the jealous games people play

Our lips are sealed

There's a weapon

Which we must use

In our defense

Silence

Spreading rumors

So far from true

Dragged up from the underworld

Just like some precious pearl

It doesn't matter what they say

In the jealous games people play

Our lips are sealed

Pay no mind to what they say

It doesn't matter anyway

Our lips are sealed

Hush my darling

Don't you cry

Quiet angel

Forget their lies

Can you hear them

They talk about us

Telling lies

Well that's no surprise

Can you see them

See right through them

They have no shield

No secrets to reveal

It doesn't matter what they say

In the jealous games people play

Our lips are sealed

Pay no mind to what they say

It doesn't matter anyway

Our lips are sealed

Our lips are sealed

Our lips are sealed
