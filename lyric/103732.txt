You complete me

Like air & water boy I need thee

And when I'm in your arms I feel free, fallen

My head's up in the clouds

In love, I'm proud to say it loud

Like an accident it happened

Outta nowhere it just happened

And I ain't mad at all because...

I've fallen...head over heels

I've fallen....in love with you

I've fallen... and I can't get up

Don't wanna get up because of love

I've fallen...head over heels

I've fallen....in love with you

I've fallen... and I can't get up

Don't wanna get up because of love

Baby to let you get away is crazy

So I'm doin' what it takes

To make you pledge your love to me

You see, 'cause I'm trying to be your lady

Forever and ever baby

The picture wouldn't be the same

If you weren't standing next to me

Can't you see I've fallen

I've fallen...head over heels

I've fallen....in love with you

I've fallen... and I can't get up

Don't wanna get up because of love

I've fallen...head over heels

I've fallen....in love with you

I've fallen... and I can't get up

Don't wanna get up because of love

You compliment me, not an accessory

You're necessary

Whenever this big bad world scares me

You're there with me yeah

Security, are you here with me

You're my happiness, my joy

I smile because of you boy

I look forward to the time I spend with you

Whatever it is we do

'Cause I've fallen for you boy

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Fallen

I've fallen for you boy

Head over heels for you

So in love with you

In love, for you

Touch me, touch me

Hold me, hold me

Love me, love me

Kiss me, in love with you

Talk to me, talk to me

Caress me, lay with me

Don't want to get up, explore me

You're my everything

I've fallen...head over heels

I've fallen....in love with you

I've fallen... and I can't get up

Don't wanna get up because of love

I've fallen...head over heels

I've fallen....in love with you

I've fallen... and I can't get up

Don't wanna get up because of love

I've fallen...head over heels

I've fallen....in love with you

I've fallen... and I can't get up

Don't wanna get up because of love
